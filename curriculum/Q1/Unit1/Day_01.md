### 🌍 Cultural Spotlight: Greetings Are Never Just Words

Spanish is spoken across **21 countries** on 4 continents. The form a greeting takes is a cultural signature:

* **Colombia 🇨🇴:** In Seño Bluemel’s hometown of **Barranquilla**, greetings are warm (*calidez*). Coastal Colombians add energy with **¡Chévere!** and often use physical touch (kisses/hugs) between friends.
* **Mexico 🇲🇽:** The largest Spanish-speaking population. "Cool" is **¡Qué padre!** and informal greetings often include *¿Qué onda?*
* **Argentina & Uruguay 🇦🇷🇺🇾:** These regions use *vos* instead of *tú*. A common greeting is **¡Buenas!** (a universal shortcut).
* **Spain 🇪🇸:** "Cool" is **¡Guay!**. Friends greet with two kisses (starting on the right side).
* **Missouri 🇺🇸:** Midwestern greetings are warm but maintain personal space (waves/handshakes).

### 📋 Activity Procedures & Teacher Guidance (Core Delivery)



| Time | Activity Title | Procedure & Instructional Details | Teacher Tips & Guidance | Examples |
|:---:|---|---|---|---|
| **5 min** | **Warm-Up / Entry** | Stand at the door. Greet students individually as they enter. Use heavy gesturing. | Use 100% target language. Use gestures for *Pasa* and *Siéntate*. | *"¡Hola! ¡Bienvenidos! Pasa. Siéntate, por favor."* |
| **18 min** | **Input: Teacher CI Script** | Deliver the **Identity & Global Map** script (found below). Use a map and thumbs-up for slang. | Focus on the "Cool" words to hook interest. No translation needed—use your body! | *"Yo soy de Colombia. ¡Chévere!"* |
| **15 min** | **Task: El Pasaporte Inicial** | Students create a desk name tag. Front: Name. Back: Mini-map circling MO and Colombia. | This is Artifact #1 for the Unit 1 portfolio. Ensures local-to-global connection. | *Front: Me llamo [Name]* |
| **7 min** | **Comparison Discussion** | Whole-class think-pair-share about greeting styles (Midwest vs. Latin America/Spain). | Use this to normalize regional variations as cultural assets. | *"Is it different to greet a teacher vs. a friend?"* |
| **5 min** | **Exit Ticket** | High-five exit. Students must state name and a greeting/goodbye to leave. | **Live-Grade:** Check for *Me llamo* and *Adiós/Hasta luego*. | **S:** "Me llamo Maria. ¡Adiós!" |

### 📘 Pedagogical Blueprint: How to Implement this Lesson

**1. The Mechanics of Welcome (TPR):**
On Day 1, your body is the dictionary. This lowers "Affective Filter" (anxiety). When you say *Mundo grande*, draw a massive circle in the air. This ensures comprehension without English.

**2. The "Insiders" Slang Strategy:**
Teaching *Chévere, Qué padre,* and *Guay* immediately gives students "Cultural Capital." It shows them that Spanish is not a monolith but a vibrant collection of diverse voices.

**3. Script for the Teacher (CI Model):**
> *[Stand at the front with a map. Wave.]*
> "¡Hola! ¡Hola, hola! Bienvenidos. Welcome to Spanish! Yo soy la **Seño Bluemel**. Yo soy de **Colombia**. [Point to Barranquilla]. Sol, calor, Caribe. ¡Chévere! But Spanish is not only Colombia. [Sweep hand across map]. Es México, es España, es Argentina. ¡21 países! A big world—un mundo grande. Now, I want to know YOU. ¿Cómo te llamas? [Point to self] Yo me llamo Seño Bluemel. [Point to student] ¿Y tú?"

### 🚀 Differentiation & Enrichment

* **Support (Struggling):** Provide a visual anchor chart with phonetic guides (e.g., *Hola* = "Oh-la").
* **Enrichment (Achieving):** Challenge students to find one more regional word for "cool" (e.g., *¡Bacano!* in Colombia or *¡Copado!* in Argentina).
* **ELL/Heritage:** Invite heritage speakers to share their family's specific regional greetings.
