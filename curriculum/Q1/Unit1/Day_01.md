### 🎯 Lesson Objectives (UbD Backward Design)

**Enduring Understanding:** Spanish is a living, global bridge. Knowing how to greet someone is the first step toward intercultural competence and connection with over 500 million speakers.

**Essential Question:** How does the way we say "hello" reflect our identity and our respect for others' cultures?

**Transfer Goal:** Students will begin building the linguistic and cultural foundations necessary for the Unit 1 "International Student Summit" IPA (Day 20).

### 🌍 Cultural Spotlight: 21 Countries, One Language

Spanish is a global powerhouse spoken in **Europe, Africa, North America, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean.**

* **Diversity of Greeting:** In many Spanish-speaking cultures, greetings are physical and warm (kisses on the cheek or hugs), reflecting a cultural value of *personalismo* (personal connection). 
* **Linguistic Identity:** While the core language is the same, each of the 21 countries has its own "flavor." For example, a student from **Equatorial Guinea (Africa)** might greet you differently than a student from **Argentina** or **Spain**. 
* **Inclusivity Note:** This curriculum celebrates all 21 nations equally, ensuring students see the full "tapestry" of the Spanish-speaking world.

### 🕐 Lesson Timeline (50 Minutes)

**Warm-Up / Entry (5 min)**
Teacher stands at the door, greeting each student with a gesture and a smile: *¡Hola! ¡Bienvenidos! Pasa, por favor.*

**Input: The "Global Passport" CI Script (18 min)**
Teacher uses a large world map to point out the 21 countries. 
- "Spanish is NOT from one place. It is from Mexico, Spain, Equatorial Guinea, Argentina... 21 countries!"
- Teacher introduces themselves as one "voice" in this world (e.g., "I am Seño Bluemel; my family is from Colombia, but we will learn about all 21 countries together!").
- Practice *¿Cómo te llamas?* and *Me llamo...* using a "ball toss" or "hot potato" to keep the energy high.



**Student Activity: El Pasaporte Inicial (15 min)**
Students create a **Desk Passport** (Name Tag).
- **Front:** *Me llamo [Name]* + colors/flags of any of the 21 countries they feel curious about.
- **Back:** A "Greeting Menu" where they circle their favorite way to say hello today.

**Cultural Comparison (7 min)**
Think-Pair-Share: Compare "Midwest American" greeting norms (waves/space) with "Hispanic" greeting norms (hugs/kisses/warmth). Discuss how both are "correct" within their own cultural context.

**Exit Ticket: The High-Five Goodbye (5 min)**
Students say *Adiós* or *Hasta luego* to the teacher to "exit" the classroom.

### 📝 Scaffolding & Differentiation
- **Scaffolding:** Provide a visual "Greeting Anchor Chart" with icons for Morning, Afternoon, and Night.
- **Extension:** Heritage speakers are invited to share regional greetings used in their homes (e.g., *¿Qué onda?* or *¿Cómo andás?*) to validate their home language as an academic asset.
