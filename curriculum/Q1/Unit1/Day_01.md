* **Can-Do (Interpretive):** I can identify at least 5 cognates (words that look/sound like English) used in today's lesson.
* **Can-Do (Interpretive):** I can respond to basic non-verbal cues from the teacher (standing, sitting, listening).
* **Can-Do (Presentational):** I can state one goal I have for my Spanish journey this year.

### 📋 Activity Procedures & Teacher Guidance (Core Delivery)

| Time | Activity Title | Procedure & Instructional Details | Teacher Tips & Guidance | Examples |
|:---:|---|---|---|---|
| **10 min** | **Input: El Monólogo Cognado** | Teacher speaks 100% Spanish for 5 minutes. Use heavy gestures and cognates (*clase, fantástico, inteligente, música*). | Do not break character. Use your "teacher voice" and physical acting to show that they *can* understand without English. | "¡Bienvenidos a la clase de español! La clase es fantástica." |
| **12 min** | **Task: La Cacería de Cognados** | Students look at a projected text in Spanish and highlight words they think they recognize based on English. | This builds "Linguistic Confidence." It proves to them that they already know some Spanish. | *Doctor, Animal, Familia, Radio, Chocolate.* |
| **15 min** | **Interaction: El Mapa Global** | Show a map of the 21 countries. Point and say: *"Aquí se habla español."* Students place a sticker on a country they find interesting. | Connect the language to the world immediately. It’s not just a subject; it’s a global passport. | "En Colombia, se habla español. En España, se habla español." |
| **8 min** | **Discussion: El Contrato de 90%** | (Switch to English briefly) Explain the 90% target language goal. Discuss why we use context and gestures instead of dictionaries. | Be transparent. Students need to know *why* we don't translate everything—it builds their "acquisition" muscle. | "We learn Spanish like we learned our first language: through context." |
| **5 min** | **Reflexión: Salida (Exit Ticket)** | Students write one Spanish word they learned today and one thing they are excited about. | Collect these to gauge the initial "vibe" and comfort level of the class. | "I learned 'Hola' and I am excited to travel one day." |

### 📘 Pedagogical Blueprint: How to Implement this Lesson

**1. The Power of Gestures:**
On Day 1, your body is your best dictionary. Over-exaggerate your movements. If you say "escuchen," cup your ear. If you say "clase," sweep your arms across the room.

**2. Cognates are Your Bridge:**
Lean heavily on words like *estudiante, profesor, excelente, atención*. This lowers the Affective Filter (anxiety) and makes students feel successful on their very first day.

**3. Establishing the "Safe Space":**
Make it clear that mistakes are expected. A proficiency-based classroom is a "low-stakes, high-engagement" environment.
