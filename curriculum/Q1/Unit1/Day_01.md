### 📋 Activity Procedures & Teacher Guidance (Core Delivery)



| Time | Activity Title | Procedure & Instructional Details | Teacher Tips & Guidance | Examples |
|:---:|---|---|---|---|
| **8 min** | **Activador: El Círculo de Saludos** | Students stand in a circle. Teacher models a greeting and a specific gesture (wave, handshake, or slight nod). Students repeat and pass it around the circle like a "wave." | Observe for physical comfort with gestures. Use "high energy" to lower the affective filter on day one. Ensure students are making eye contact. | **T:** "¡Hola!" (waves)<br>**C:** "¡Hola!" (waves) |
| **12 min** | **Input: The Greeting Matrix (Interpretive)** | Use Comprehensible Input (CI) to show the difference between *Buenos días*, *Buenas tardes*, and *Buenas noches*. Use a sun/moon drawing on the board. | Use a clock visual. Emphasize that "Buenas tardes" starts after lunch in many cultures, not strictly at 12:00 PM. | *Show 2:00 PM on clock* → "¡Buenas tardes!" |
| **15 min** | **Task: Speed Friending (Interpersonal)** | Students rotate in two lines. They have 30 seconds to greet, exchange names (*¿Cómo te llamas? / Me llamo...*), and say goodbye. | **Live-Grade:** Move with a clipboard. Check for eye contact and correct use of "Me llamo" (ensure they aren't saying 'My name is' in English). | **A:** "¡Hola! ¿Cómo te llamas?"<br>**B:** "Me llamo Luis. ¿Y tú?"<br>**A:** "Me llamo Ana. ¡Adiós!" |
| **10 min** | **Presentational: The Desk Passport** | Students create a small card for their desk with a greeting, their name, and one "Mood Emoji" (prelude to Day 2 emotions). | Use this to walk around and practice name pronunciation. This becomes the teacher's "cheat sheet" for the first week. | **Card:** ¡Hola! Me llamo Carlos. (Emoji: 😄) |
| **5 min** | **Reflexión: The Cultural Beso** | Brief discussion on the "beso" (cheek kiss) vs. the handshake. Ask: "Why do some cultures touch more during greetings than others?" | Frame this as "Cultural Logic" rather than "weirdness." Set the standard for cultural respect in the room. | "In Spain, it's two kisses; in Mexico, usually one." |

### 📊 ACTFL-Aligned Performance Rubric (4-Tier Formative)

| Criteria | **Exceeds (4)** | **Meets (3)** | **Approaching (2)** | **Below (1)** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Comprehensibility** | Pronunciation is clear; vowels (O, A) are crisp. Natural gestures used without hesitation. | Understood by those used to language learners. Gestures are appropriate. | Meaning is clear but relies on heavy English accent or phonetics. | Incomprehensible; uses English greetings or sounds exclusively. |
| **Language Control** | Uses *Me llamo* and *¿Y tú?* correctly and fluidly within the interaction. | Uses *Me llamo* correctly with minimal hesitation or restarts. | Confuses *Me llamo* with *Mi llamo* or uses English syntax. | Cannot state name or use a greeting accurately without help. |
| **Interpersonal Quality** | Maintains eye contact; reacts naturally with *Mucho gusto* or a smile. | Polite interaction; follows the script provided by the teacher. | Minimal interaction; looks at the floor or relies on the desk card. | Refuses to interact with peers or uses English exclusively. |
| **Cultural Awareness** | Selects the correct greeting for the current time of day automatically. | Uses a greeting appropriate for the time of day with slight prompting. | Uses "Hola" regardless of time of day, context, or social setting. | No awareness of time-based greetings or cultural gestures. |

### 📘 Pedagogical Blueprint: How to Implement this Lesson
> *A guide for the first day of high-performance language learning.*

**1. The "100% Target Language" Myth:**
On Day 1, use 90% Spanish for greetings and basic commands, but use 10% English for the "Reflexión" to ensure the cultural safety and expectations of the room are established. The goal is "Comprehensible," not "Confusing."

**2. Live-Grading on Day 1:**
Do not give a grade for the gradebook today. Use the rubric to identify "The Quiet Ones." These are the students you will prioritize for a "High-Five" or extra greeting on Day 2 to build their confidence early.

**3. Movement is Essential:**
The "Speed Friending" activity is designed to break the ice physically. If students stay in their seats on Day 1, they will stay in their shells for the rest of the quarter. Movement equals engagement.

### 🚀 Differentiation & Enrichment

* **Support (Struggling):** Provide a "Greeting Map" on the board with phonetics (e.g., O-la). Allow them to keep their desk card in hand during the speed friending.
* **Enrichment (Achieving):** Challenge them to use *Mucho gusto* (Pleased to meet you) or ask *¿Cómo estás?* (How are you?) if they have prior Spanish exposure.
