### 🎯 Lesson Objectives (UbD Backward Design)

**Enduring Understanding:** Spanish is not one language from one place — it is a living, global language shaped by millions of people across dozens of cultures. Knowing how to greet someone is the first step to connecting with that world.

**Essential Question:** Why does it matter *how* you say hello — and does it change depending on where you are in the Spanish-speaking world?

**Transfer Goal (toward Day 5 IPA):** Students will begin building the greeting vocabulary and cultural awareness they need to interact with a "global visitor" in the Day 5 simulated exchange.

### 🌍 Cultural Spotlight: Greetings Are Never Just Words

Spanish is spoken across **21 countries** on 4 continents — and the way people say hello reflects who they are, where they live, and what they value.

**Colombia 🇨🇴** — Seño Bluemel's hometown of **Barranquilla** sits on the Caribbean coast — a city of *calidez* (warmth), Carnival, and Afro-Colombian and indigenous cultural roots. Coastal Colombians greet with energy and often add *¡Chévere!* (Cool!) to show enthusiasm. Greetings are physical and warm — a kiss on the cheek or a hug is common between friends and family.

**Mexico 🇲🇽** — The equivalent of *¡Chévere!* in Mexico is *¡Qué padre!* or *¡Padrísimo!* Informal greetings among friends often include *¿Qué onda?* ("What's up?"). Mexico is home to the largest Spanish-speaking population in the world.

**Argentina & Uruguay 🇦🇷🇺🇾** — These countries use *vos* instead of *tú* as the informal "you" — a fully standard, respected regional pronoun. An Argentine might greet a friend with *¡Buenas!* (a shortcut for any time-based greeting) or *¿Cómo andás?* instead of *¿Cómo estás?*

**Spain 🇪🇸** — In Spain, *¡Guay!* means cool. Greetings between friends involve two kisses on the cheek (one on each side), starting from the right. Spaniards also use *vosotros* — a plural informal "you all" not used in Latin America.

**Missouri Connection 🇺🇸** — Greetings in the American Midwest tend to be warm but maintain personal space — a wave, a "Hey, how's it going?" Handshakes are common in formal settings. This is a great point of comparison: the *feeling* of welcome is universal, but the *form* it takes is cultural.

### 🕐 Lesson Timeline (50 Minutes)

**Warm-Up / Entry (5 min)**
Teacher stands at the door as students enter, greeting each one individually: *¡Hola! ¡Bienvenidos! Pasa, pasa. Siéntate, por favor.* Use gesture for every phrase. No English. Students feel the immersion from the first second.

**Input: Teacher-Led CI Script (18 min)**

> *[Stand at the front with a large world map visible behind you. Smile wide. Wave.]*
>
> "¡Hola! ¡Hola, hola, hola! Bienvenidos. Bien — well. Venidos — you came. Welcome. ¡Bienvenidos a la clase de español!"
>
> *[Point to yourself.]*
>
> "Yo soy la Seño Bluemel. Soy — I am — Seño Bluemel. Seño. That's like 'Miss' or 'Ms.' in Spanish. Seño Bluemel. Can you say it? Seño Bluemel."
>
> *[Students repeat. Point to the map.]*
>
> "Yo soy de Colombia. Colombia — HERE. [Point to Colombia on the map.] South America. But — but — el español no es solo de Colombia. Spanish is NOT only from Colombia."
>
> *[Sweep your hand dramatically across the entire map.]*
>
> "El español es de México — HERE. De España — HERE, in Europe! De la Argentina — HERE. ¡De 21 países! 21 countries! Spanish is a GLOBAL language. Un mundo grande. A big world."
>
> *[Point to Barranquilla specifically.]*
>
> "Yo soy de Barranquilla. Barranquilla está en la COSTA — the coast — el Caribe. The Caribbean! [Gesture waves with your arms.] Sol. Sun. [Draw a sun in the air.] Calor. Heat. ¡Mucho calor! Barranquilla es una ciudad muy alegre — very happy, very alive."
>
> *[Point to the U.S., then to Missouri.]*
>
> "Y ustedes — YOU — están en Missouri. Missouri está aquí, en el centro de los Estados Unidos. No hay océano — no ocean — but Missouri is beautiful. Different from Barranquilla — diferente — but beautiful. ¿Missouri es bonito? Sí o no? [Cup hand to ear.] ¡Sí!"
>
> *[Now shift to greetings — hold up fingers to count.]*
>
> "Greetings. Saludos. In Spanish, we have many ways to say hello. Watch. Hola. [Wave.] Ho-la. Simple. Universal. Hola. [Students repeat.]"
>
> *[Point to a window showing daylight or a picture of morning.]*
>
> "Morning — mañana. Buenos DÍAS. Good morning. Bue-nos DÍ-as. [Students repeat with you.] And in the afternoon — tarde — Buenas TARDES. [Students repeat.]"
>
> *[Now — the cultural layer.]*
>
> "In Colombia — especially on the coast, in Barranquilla — if something is cool, we say: ¡CHÉVERE! [Thumbs up, big smile.] Chévere. Cool. Awesome. Can you say it? ¡Chévere!"
>
> *[Students repeat enthusiastically.]*
>
> "In MEXICO — same feeling, different word. ¡Qué padre! [Thumbs up.] Qué padre — how cool! And in SPAIN — ¡Guay! [Thumbs up.] Guay. Same feeling. Three different countries. Three different words. Spanish is NOT one-size-fits-all."
>
> *[Move to names.]*
>
> "Now — I want to know YOUR name. ¿Cómo te llamas? Cómo — how. Te llamas — you call yourself. How do you call yourself? What's your name? ¿CÓMO TE LLAMAS?"
>
> *[Point to yourself.]*
>
> "Yo me llamo Seño Bluemel. [Point to a student.] ¿Y tú? ¿Cómo te llamas tú? — [Student responds or teacher models:] Me llamo [Name]. Me llamo — I call myself. My name is."
>
> *[Repeat with 3–4 students around the room, using gesture and eye contact.]*
>
> "¡Chévere! I know your name now. ¡Mucho gusto! Nice to meet you. This is the beginning of something very big."

**Student Activity: El Pasaporte Inicial (15 min)**

Students create a **Desk Passport** — their name tag, their first cultural artifact, and their first personal connection to the Spanish-speaking world.

- **Front:** *Me llamo [Name]* in large, bold letters. Students decorate with colors of any Spanish-speaking country's flag they choose.
- **Back Left:** A small outline map of the Americas. Students circle **Missouri** and **Colombia**, then draw a star on any other Spanish-speaking country they're curious about.
- **Back Right:** A **Greeting Menu**. Students check the greeting they feel most comfortable using *today* — Hola / Buenos días / Buenas tardes — and write one word they want to remember from the cultural spotlight (*¡Chévere!, ¡Qué padre!,* or *¡Guay!*).

**Cultural Comparison Discussion (7 min)**

Brief whole-class discussion using think-pair-share:

*"When you walk into school in the morning, how do you greet your friends? How do you greet a teacher? Is it different?"*

Teacher connects student responses to the cultural data: Colombians may hug and kiss cheeks; Argentines might say *¡Buenas!* to everyone; Spaniards do a two-cheek kiss greeting. In the U.S. Midwest, a wave and "Hey!" is the norm. None of these is wrong — they're all culturally meaningful.

**Exit Ticket: The High-Five Goodbye (5 min)**

As students pack up and exit, each student must high-five the teacher and say either *Adiós* or *Hasta luego* — and correctly answer *¿Cómo te llamas?* if asked. Teacher gives a thumbs up and responds *¡Chévere!* or *¡Mucho gusto!* for every successful exchange.

### 📺 Seño Bluemel Resource

> 🎬 **Watch:** Visit [youtube.com/@SenoBluemelQueChevere](https://youtube.com/@SenoBluemelQueChevere) and show the **Channel Trailer or Welcome Video** in class — students will hear authentic Barranquilla Spanish, see the Caribbean coast, and experience the *calidez* of Colombian culture firsthand. Also great for students to watch at home after Day 1 to reinforce greetings and cultural context.

---

### 📊 Formative Assessment

**Exit High-Five Check:** Can the student say *Adiós* or *Hasta luego* on exit? Can they respond to *¿Cómo te llamas?* with *Me llamo ___?* These are the two non-negotiable Novice-Low benchmarks for Day 1.

**Passport Observation:** Teacher scans completed Desk Passports for the geography connection (Missouri + Colombia circled) and the greeting menu selection. Look for students who added a cultural vocab word — this signals readiness for accelerated cultural content in Days 2–4.

**IPA Connection:** The Desk Passport serves as artifact #1 in the Unit 1 portfolio. The name exchange and greeting vocabulary practiced today are the foundation of the Day 5 formative IPA.

---

### 📝 Scaffolding & Differentiation Notes

- **Scaffolding:** Provide a visual anchor chart with all greeting phrases + phonetic pronunciation guides for students who need decoding support.
- **Extension:** Challenge early finishers to find one more regional slang word for "cool" in a Spanish-speaking country not covered today (e.g., *¡Bacano!* in Colombia, *¡Copado!* in Argentina).
- **ELL/Heritage Speakers:** Invite heritage speakers to share how their family greets — honor regional variation as an asset, not a deviation from "standard" Spanish.
