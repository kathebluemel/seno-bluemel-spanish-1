### 📌 Standards Leadership & Alignment

**National Standards Alignment (Primary)**
*Grounded in the frameworks of **ACTFL, NCSSFL, AATSP, and JNCL-NCLIS**.*
- **Communication – Interpersonal:** Conduct a sustained exchange covering age, specific birthday dates, and personal celebration rituals.
- **Communication – Presentational:** Synthesize a peer's identity into a formal biographical profile for a community context.
- **Cultures – Practices:** Compare global "Rites of Passage" (Quinceañeras vs. Sweet 16s) and regional music traditions (*Las Mañanitas*).
- **Comparisons – Language:** Analyze the etymological shift from "Birthday" (Birth-focused) to *Cumpleaños* (Fulfillment-focused).

**NCSSFL-ACTFL Can-Do Statements**
> *I can explain the linguistic meaning of 'cumpleaños' and how it differs from 'birthday'.*
> *I can ask and answer birthday-related questions with 90% accuracy in date formatting.*
> *I can identify specific regional differences in birthday music and food across Latin America and West Africa.*

**Missouri CLEs (Secondary Alignment)**
- FL.2.A.1 — Compare birthday and celebration practices across Spanish-speaking cultures.
- FL.4.A.1 — Examine how word etymology reflects cultural values regarding time.

### 🎯 Lesson Objectives (UbD Backward Design)

**Enduring Understanding:** A birthday is more than a date; it is a "fulfillment" of time. How a community celebrates a new year of life—whether through dawn serenades, communal feasts, or religious offerings—reveals its deepest values.

**Essential Question:** How does the language we use to celebrate life shape our perception of growing older?

### 📚 Vocabulary Synthesis: The "Fulfillment" of Years



**The Linguistic Shift:**
* **Cumpleaños** = *Cumplir* (to fulfill/complete) + *Años* (years). 
* **The Perspective:** In Spanish, you aren't just "born" again; you have successfully **completed** a cycle of time.

**Regional Lexicon for "Cake":**
* **El Pastel:** Mexico, Spain, Central America.
* **La Torta:** Colombia, Venezuela, Argentina (Note: In Mexico, a *torta* is a sandwich!).
* **El Bizcocho:** Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.

### 🌍 Cultural Spotlight: Serenades and Earth-Offerings

* **Mexico 🇲🇽 — Las Mañanitas:** Birthdays are public and musical. The day begins at dawn with *Las Mañanitas*, a serenade that honors the birthday person before the sun rises.
* **Andean Highlands 🇧🇴🇵🇪:** In indigenous communities, the 15th birthday (Quinceañera) isn't just a party; it's a spiritual moment where offerings are made to **Pachamama** (Mother Earth) to thank her for the years completed.
* **Equatorial Guinea 🇬🇶 — The Ubuntu Approach:** In Fang culture, birthdays are often communal. You don't have a party "for" you; you host a gathering to share your life's "fulfillment" with the elders and the children of the village.

### 🕐 Lesson Timeline (50 Minutes)

**Warm-Up: The Regional Cake Challenge (5 min)**
Teacher displays images of a sandwich, a birthday cake, and a sponge cake. Students must use their regional knowledge to label them correctly as *Pastel*, *Torta*, or *Bizcocho* based on the country.

**Input: The "Years Fulfilled" CI Script (16 min)**
- Teacher mimes completing a journey. "I am not just 'born' today. I have **completed** (*cumplido*) 15 years. I am a finisher!"
- Model the conversation: *¿Cuándo es tu cumpleaños? -> Mi cumpleaños es el... de...*
- Introduce the **"Mordida"** (Mexico) or the **"Tirón de orejas"** (Spain—pulling ears for every year) to show the physical nature of celebrations.



**Activity: The Birthday Interview (14 min)**
Students interview a "Global Partner" (a classmate assigned a specific country from Week 2). They must find out the partner's age and birthday and write it down in the **DD/MM** format.

**Activity: The Serenade Analysis (10 min)**
Listen to a 60-second clip of *Las Mañanitas*. Students identify the mood (Joyful? Solemn?) and discuss why starting a birthday with music is a "Cultural Gift."

**Exit Ticket: The Linguistic Reflection (5 min)**
Which do you prefer: the idea of a "Birthday" (day of birth) or a "Cumpleaños" (completion of years)? Why? Write your answer and your full birthday in Spanish.

### 📝 Scaffolding & Differentiation
- **Scaffolding:** Provide a "Birthday Sentence Starter" anchor chart for learners who struggle with the *El [número] de [mes]* order.
- **Extension:** Research why Spanish people pull ears (*Tirón de orejas*) on birthdays and write a 2-sentence explanation.
- **IPA Connection:** Today's "Birthday Profile" is a direct 1:1 rehearsal for the Presentational writing task on Day 15.
