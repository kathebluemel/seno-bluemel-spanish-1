### 📌 Standards & Objectives

**ACTFL World-Readiness Standards (Primary)**
- **Communication – Interpersonal:** Conduct a sustained 8–10 line conversation covering greetings, age, birthday date, and a cultural birthday observation.
- **Communication – Presentational:** Create a written birthday profile of a partner using all Week 3 structures.
- **Cultures – Practices & Perspectives:** Compare birthday celebration customs across the Spanish-speaking world with U.S. traditions, identifying similarities and meaningful differences.
- **Comparisons – Language:** Analyze why Spanish uses *cumpleaños* (years-fulfilling) as the word for birthday — and what that etymology reveals about cultural values.

**NCSSFL-ACTFL Can-Do Statements**
> *I can ask and answer* ¿Cuándo es tu cumpleaños? *with a full date response.*
> *I can combine age, birthday date, and greeting language into a natural conversation.*
> *I can identify at least two culturally specific birthday customs from Spanish-speaking countries.*

**Missouri CLEs (Secondary)**
- FL.1.A.1 — Use target language in multi-topic conversations including personal celebrations.
- FL.2.A.1 — Compare birthday and celebration practices across Spanish-speaking cultures.
- FL.4.A.1 — Examine how word etymology reflects cultural values.

### 🎯 Lesson Objectives (UbD Backward Design)

**Enduring Understanding:** A birthday is not just a personal milestone — it is a cultural event. How a community celebrates life reveals what it values: family, faith, community, or individual achievement.

**Essential Question:** What does a birthday celebration tell you about a culture?

**Transfer Goal (toward Day 15 IPA):** Students will conduct the full cumpleaños conversation independently in the IPA and produce a written birthday profile of a fictional "global visitor."

### 📚 Vocabulary Focus (Full Week 3 Synthesis)

**Birthday-Specific Vocabulary:**
| Spanish | English |
|---|---|
| el cumpleaños | the birthday (lit: *the years-fulfilling*) |
| ¿Cuándo es tu cumpleaños? | When is your birthday? |
| Mi cumpleaños es el ___ de ___. | My birthday is the ___ of ___. |
| ¿Cuántos años tienes? | How old are you? |
| Tengo ___ años. | I am ___ years old. |
| ¡Feliz cumpleaños! | Happy birthday! |
| ¡Que cumplas muchos más! | May you have many more! |
| la fiesta | the party |
| el pastel / la torta | the cake (regional: *pastel* = Mexico/Spain; *torta* = some Latin American countries; *bizcocho* = Caribbean) |
| los regalos | the gifts |
| la vela | the candle |
| el deseo | the wish |
| soplar | to blow (the candles) |

**Etymology Spotlight:**
> *Cumpleaños* = *cumplir* (to fulfill/complete) + *años* (years). A birthday is the day you *complete* another year. This framing — fulfillment, completion — reflects a cultural perspective on time as something accumulated with purpose, not just passed.

### 🌍 Cultural Spotlight: Birthday Traditions Across the Spanish-Speaking World

**Mexico 🇲🇽 — Las Mañanitas:**
In Mexico, birthdays begin at dawn with a traditional song called *Las Mañanitas* — often sung by family members, mariachi bands, or friends gathering outside the birthday person's window or door before they wake up. The tradition is so deeply embedded that even the president of Mexico receives *Las Mañanitas* on their birthday. It is distinctly different from the American "Happy Birthday to You" — it is a serenade, a gift of music.

**Bolivia & Peru 🇧🇴🇵🇪 — The Quinceañera Across the Andes:**
In the Andean communities of both Bolivia and Peru, the quinceañera combines Catholic ceremony with indigenous Andean traditions. In some Aymara and Quechua communities, a girl's 15th birthday ceremony includes offerings to *Pachamama* (Mother Earth) — a blending of pre-Columbian spiritual practice with Spanish Catholic celebration. The result is uniquely Andean, found nowhere else in the Spanish-speaking world.

**Equatorial Guinea 🇬🇶 — Community Celebration:**
In the Fang communities of Equatorial Guinea, birthdays are often community events rather than individual ones. The Fang culture values collective celebration — the birthday person is not the center of a party thrown *for* them but a reason for the community to gather *together*. Elders are honored with songs and storytelling. This communal lens on celebration contrasts sharply with the American tradition of the individual "birthday boy/girl."

**Colombia 🇨🇴 — Regional Variation:**
In Barranquilla, birthdays can become mini-carnivals — music, dancing, and *calidez* are non-negotiable. The song *Cumpleaños Feliz* (the Spanish-language equivalent of Happy Birthday) is always sung, but in coastal Colombian style — up-tempo, with percussion, and often with group dancing afterward. In Bogotá, more formal celebrations are common. Same country, different energy.

**U.S. Comparison:** The American birthday tradition — cake with candles, making a wish, blowing them out, singing "Happy Birthday" — is itself a relatively modern construct (19th–20th century). Spanish-speaking traditions are often older, more communal, and more musically rich.

### 🕐 Lesson Timeline (50 Minutes)

**Warm-Up / Activador: Month Speed Round (5 min)**
Teacher calls a month in English — students respond in Spanish within 3 seconds. Then reverse. Then: teacher calls a date numerically (*"the 15th of August"*) — students write it in full Spanish (*el quince de agosto*). Quick and cumulative.

**Input: Teacher-Led CI Script (16 min)**

> *[Walk in carrying a small pretend cake or drawing one on the board with a candle.]*
>
> "Clase — ¿qué es esto? What is this? Un pastel. A CAKE. Un pastel. And a candle — una vela. Una vela. ¿Por qué tenemos un pastel hoy? Why do we have cake? ¡Porque es un cumpleaños!"
>
> *[Write CUMPLEAÑOS on the board — big letters.]*
>
> "Cumpleaños. Cum-ple-a-ños. Say it with me — cumpleaños. This word is BEAUTIFUL. ¿Por qué? Why? Because cumpleaños means — literally — the years you FULFILL. Cumplir — to fulfill, to complete — años — years. Your birthday is the day you COMPLETE another year. ¿No es poético? Isn't that poetic?"
>
> *[Let students sit with that for a moment.]*
>
> "In English — 'birthday.' The day you were BORN. Backward-looking. In Spanish — cumpleaños — the years you COMPLETE. Forward-looking. Even the word shows you something about the culture."
>
> *[Now model the birthday conversation.]*
>
> "¿Cuándo es tu cumpleaños? — [Ask a student] — WHEN is your birthday? ¿Cuándo — when — es — is — tu cumpleaños — your birthday? Tell me: Mi cumpleaños es el ___ de ___."
>
> *[Student responds. Teacher reacts with genuine delight.]*
>
> "¡El [date] de [month]! ¡Chévere! ¿Y cuántos años tienes? How old are you? Tengo ___ años. [Student answers.] ¡Muy bien! ¡Feliz cumpleaños — en el futuro! Happy birthday — in the future!"
>
> *[Now the cultural layer — Mexico.]*
>
> "In MEXICO — your birthday starts BEFORE you wake up. Imagine — you're asleep. It's 6 AM. And suddenly — [hum the opening of Las Mañanitas dramatically] — your family is outside your door, singing. Las Mañanitas. The Little Mornings. A birthday serenade. No alarm clock — just music."
>
> *[Students smile. Let them imagine it.]*
>
> "In Colombia — Barranquilla especially — the birthday becomes a FIESTA. Music. Dancing. ¡Calidez! In Bolivia and Peru, a girl's quinceañera — her 15th birthday — connects to Pachamama — Mother Earth — ancient Andean tradition and Catholic ceremony combined. In Equatorial Guinea — the birthday is for the WHOLE community. Not just the person — everyone gathers."
>
> *[Close with the vocabulary for the cake ritual.]*
>
> "Las velas — the candles. El deseo — the wish. Soplar — to BLOW. Soplamos las velas — we blow the candles — y pedimos un deseo — and we make a wish. Same ritual — different songs, different food, different energy — around the world."

**Guided Practice: Birthday Profile Cards (14 min)**
Students interview a partner and complete a "Birthday Profile Card":

```
Se llama: _______________
Su cumpleaños es: el ___ de ___
Tiene ___ años.
En su familia, celebran el cumpleaños con: _______________ (can answer in English)
```

Then students flip the card and write 4 sentences in Spanish introducing their partner's birthday information to a third person, using third-person structures (*se llama, su cumpleaños es, tiene*).

**Cultural Comparison Discussion (10 min)**
Class discussion — teacher facilitates:
- *"What does your family do for birthdays? How is it similar to or different from what we learned today?"*
- *"Why do you think Mexican families sing at dawn? What does that say about the value of music in that culture?"*
- *"What does the communal birthday tradition in Equatorial Guinea tell you about what that culture values?"*

Allow heritage Spanish speakers to share personal family birthday traditions — honor them as primary cultural sources.

**Exit Ticket (5 min)**
Students write: (1) *¡Feliz cumpleaños!* — who would you say this to, and why? (2) One birthday custom they learned today that they found surprising or meaningful. (3) Their birthday in full Spanish format.

### 📝 Scaffolding & Differentiation Notes

- **Scaffolding:** Provide a Birthday Conversation Frame card students may reference during the partner profile activity (not during the IPA tomorrow).
- **Extension:** Students write a creative short story (6–8 sentences, Spanish + English allowed) about a quinceañera in a Bolivian or Peruvian Andean community, incorporating both Catholic and indigenous elements.
- **IPA Connection:** The Birthday Profile Card activity is a direct rehearsal of the Day 15 IPA presentational task. The partner conversation is a rehearsal of the IPA interpersonal task.
