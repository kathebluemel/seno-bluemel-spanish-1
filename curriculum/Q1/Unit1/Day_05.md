### 🎯 IPA Design Overview (UbD — Stage 1 Transfer)

**Enduring Understanding:** Global competence requires the flexibility to adapt language to the human being in front of you. 

**Essential Question:** How do I adjust my communication to show respect to a visitor from a different Spanish-speaking culture?

### 🌍 IPA Scenario: *¡Bienvenidos al Intercambio Internacional!*

**Student Prompt:**
> Your school is hosting an international student summit. Three students from different countries will visit today. You will meet ONE of them. You must listen for clues to determine their origin and whether to use a formal or informal register.

### 📋 IPA Task 1: Interpretive (10 minutes)

**Reading Passage:**
*"Hola. Me llamo Valentina Morales Reyes. Soy de Buenos Aires, Argentina. Buenos días, ¿cómo están todos? En mi país, los amigos dicen 'buenas' o '¿cómo andás?' — es muy normal. Me gusta mucho conocerlos."*

**Interpretive Questions:**
1. Identify the visitor's full name and explain the naming convention used.
2. Where is the visitor from?
3. Based on the phrase *¿cómo andás?*, is this an informal or formal interaction?
4. **Linguistic Clue:** What specific word identifies this as "Argentine" Spanish?
