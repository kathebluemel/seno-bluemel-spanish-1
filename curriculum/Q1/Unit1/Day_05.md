### 🎯 IPA Design Overview (UbD — Stage 1 Transfer)

**Enduring Understanding:** Effective communication requires not just vocabulary, but cultural awareness and the flexibility to adapt language to context.

**Essential Question:** When you meet someone from a different part of the Spanish-speaking world, what do you need to know — and *do* — to connect with them respectfully?

**Performance Tasks Today:**
1. **Interpretive Task** — Read or listen to a short text about a visitor.
2. **Interpersonal Task** — Live role-play interaction with the teacher or a partner acting as the "global visitor."
3. **Presentational Task** — Brief written or spoken self-introduction to the "class abroad."

### 🌍 IPA Scenario: *¡Bienvenidos al Intercambio Internacional!*

**Student Prompt (read aloud and/or posted on board):**

> Your school is hosting an international student exchange. Three students from different Spanish-speaking countries will visit your classroom today. You will meet ONE of them. You don't know yet which country they're from, so you'll need to listen carefully and adapt.
>
> Your goal: Greet them appropriately, exchange names, find out how they're doing, and say goodbye — all in Spanish.

### 📋 IPA Task 1: Interpretive (10 minutes)

**Text (provided to students as a handout or on screen):**

---

*Hola. Me llamo Valentina Morales Reyes. Soy de Buenos Aires, Argentina. Buenos días, ¿cómo están todos? En mi país, los amigos dicen "buenas" o "¿cómo andás?" — es muy normal. Me gusta mucho conocerlos.*

---

**Interpretive Task Questions:**

1. What is the visitor's full name? What do you notice about it?
2. Where is she from?
3. She uses *¿cómo andás?* — is this formal or informal? How do you know?
4. Circle any words in the passage that you recognize from this week. How many can you find?
5. Based on what we've learned, would you use *tú* or a *vos*-style greeting when you meet her? Why?

**Teacher Note:** *Andás* is the *vos* form of *andar* — students don't need to produce this form, but recognizing it as informal and Argentine ties directly to Days 2–4. Award full credit for any reasonable explanation showing cultural awareness.

---

### 📋 IPA Task 2: Interpersonal (15 minutes)

**Format:** Student pairs, or student + teacher. The "visitor" is played by either the teacher or a prepared partner using a role card.

**Visitor Role Cards (teacher selects one per pair):**

> **Card A — Valentina, Argentina 🇦🇷**
> Use: *¿Y vos, cómo te llamás?* / *¡Buenas!* / *Mucho gusto, igualmente.*
> Expect: Informal register. Warm and fast-paced.

> **Card B — Don Ernesto, Colombia 🇨🇴**
> Use: *Buenos días. ¿Cómo se llama usted?* / *Mucho gusto. El gusto es mío.*
> Expect: Formal register. Use *usted*. Note: He may use *usted* even if you're young — this is Colombian warmth.

> **Card C — Camila, Mexico 🇲🇽**
> Use: *¡Hola! ¿Qué onda? ¿Cómo te llamas?* / *Chao, ¡hasta luego!*
> Expect: Informal, casual. Fast. Friendly.

**Student Must Accomplish (scored on IPA Rubric):**
- ✅ Use an appropriate time-based greeting
- ✅ Exchange names (ask and share)
- ✅ Ask how they're doing and respond
- ✅ Match the register (formal or informal) of the visitor
- ✅ Say a culturally appropriate goodbye

---

### 📋 IPA Task 3: Presentational (10 minutes)

**Written or Spoken Prompt:**

> Imagine you are writing a short message to be read aloud at the opening of the International Exchange Assembly. In 4–6 sentences in Spanish, introduce yourself to the visiting students and welcome them. Use formal language — this is a school event.

**Sentence Frame Support (for scaffolded learners):**

```
Buenos ___. Me llamo ___. Soy de ___. 
Mucho gusto. Bienvenidos a nuestra escuela.
¿Cómo ___ usted?
```

### 🌟 Week 1 Debrief Questions (Closing Discussion)

- What was one greeting custom from a Spanish-speaking country that surprised you?
- Why do you think it matters to know *where* someone is from when you're speaking Spanish?
- What is one thing you want to get better at before Unit 2?

### 📝 Teacher Notes: Scoring & Next Steps

- This is a **formative** IPA — use results to identify students who need re-teaching on register or cultural context before Unit 2.
- Students who demonstrate strong cultural reasoning (connecting language choices to specific countries) are ready for accelerated content in Unit 2.
- Collect presentational writing samples as the first piece in the Unit 1 portfolio.
- **Unit 2 Preview:** Numbers, age, and where you're from — students will expand their interpersonal interaction capacity.
