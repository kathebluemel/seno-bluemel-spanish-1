### 🎯 Learning Targets & Can-Do Statements
> **Essential Question:** When you meet someone from a different part of the Spanish-speaking world, what do you need to know—and *do*—to connect with them respectfully?

* **Enduring Understanding:** Effective communication requires not just vocabulary, but cultural flexibility to adapt language to the context and the speaker.
* **Can-Do (Interpretive):** I can recognize a speaker's origin and greeting style from a written or spoken introduction.
* **Can-Do (Interpersonal):** I can greet a "visitor," exchange names, and match their level of formality (Formal vs. Informal).
* **Can-Do (Presentational):** I can write or speak a 4–6 sentence self-introduction for a school assembly.

### 🌍 Cultural Spotlight: The IPA Scenario
**Scenario:** *¡Bienvenidos al Intercambio Internacional!*
Your school is hosting an international student exchange. Three visitors from different countries (**Argentina 🇦🇷, Colombia 🇨🇴, and Mexico 🇲🇽**) are arriving. You must use the "Cultural Clues" learned this week to identify them and greet them in their regional style.



* **Argentina:** Listen for *vos* and *¿Cómo andás?*
* **Colombia:** Listen for high formality (*Usted*) and warm phrases like *El gusto es mío*.
* **Mexico:** Listen for friendly, fast-paced informal greetings like *¿Qué onda?*

### 📋 Activity Procedures & Teacher Guidance (IPA Delivery)

| Time | Activity Title | Procedure & Instructional Details | Teacher Tips & Guidance | Examples |
|:---:|---|---|---|---|
| **5 min** | **Warm-Up: Register ID** | Teacher greets the class in 3 different styles. Students hold up cards (A, C, or M) for the country. | Mimic the accents and body language from earlier this week. | *"¡Buenas! ¿Cómo andás vos?"* |
| **10 min** | **IPA Task 1: Interpretive** | Students read a short bio of "Valentina from Argentina" and answer 5 comprehension questions. | Focus on identifying *vos* as an informal clue. | *Identify Valentina's two last names.* |
| **15 min** | **IPA Task 2: Interpersonal** | Role-play: Students meet a "Visitor" (Teacher or Role Card Partner) and must match the register. | Use a rubric to track if they match *Usted* vs. *Tú* based on the card. | **Card A:** Argentina/Informal. |
| **10 min** | **IPA Task 3: Presentational** | Students write a formal 4–6 sentence intro for an "Assembly." | Provide sentence frames for students who need scaffolding. | *"Buenos días. Me llamo..."* |
| **10 min** | **Debrief & Reflection** | Discussion: What was the hardest part? What surprised you about greeting styles? | Use this to prep for Unit 2 (Personal Traits/Feelings). | *"Why does 'vos' matter?"* |

### 📘 Pedagogical Blueprint: How to Implement this Assessment

**1. The "Integrated" Nature of the IPA:**
This isn't a vocabulary test; it’s a performance task. The **Interpretive** task (reading about Valentina) feeds into the **Interpersonal** task (speaking). Students are "learning" about their visitor before they meet them.

**2. Managing the Register Shift:**
During the interpersonal task, ensure you (the teacher) or the student "Visitor" are very clear with your cues. If the card says **Formal (Don Ernesto)**, use a deep voice and a serious posture to signal the student needs to use *Usted*.

**3. Script for the Teacher (CI Warm-Up):**
> *[Walk in with a scarf and a playful accent]*
> "¡Hola! **¿Cómo andás vos?** ¿Soy de México? No... ¿Soy de Colombia? No... ¡Soy de **Argentina**! Muy bien.
> 
> [Change to a professional, stiff posture]
> "Buenos días. **¿Cómo se llama usted?** El gusto es mío. This is **Colombia**. This is FORMAL.
> 
> Today, you will show me your 'Global Passport.' You will read, you will speak, and you will write. ¡Ustedes son fantásticos!"

### 🚀 Differentiation & Enrichment

* **Support (Struggling):** Provide a "Cheat Sheet" for Task 2 with three icons: A friend (Tú), A teacher (Usted), and a flag (Regional slang).
* **Enrichment (Achieving):** Challenge students to include a regional slang word (*Chévere, Qué padre*) correctly during their live role-play.
* **Heritage Speakers:** Encourage them to play the "Visitor" role, using their family's authentic accent and regional vocabulary to challenge their peers.
* **ELL Support:** Allow ELL students to bridge concepts using their home language in the "Cultural Reflection" portion of the assessment to show deep understanding.

### 📊 Performance Rubric (Formative)

| Criterion | Exceeds (4) | Meets (3) | Approaching (2) | Beginning (1) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Interpersonal** | Correct register, natural flow, uses regional cues. | Correct register, full exchange. | Some register errors, partial exchange. | Minimal communication. |
| **Interpretive** | All details identified with cultural reasoning. | Most details correct. | Identifies main idea but misses nuance. | Struggles to identify names/origin. |
