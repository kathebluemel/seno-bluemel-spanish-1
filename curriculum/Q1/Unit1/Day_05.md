### 📋 Activity Procedures & Teacher Guidance (Core Delivery)


| Time | Activity Title | Procedure & Instructional Details | Teacher Tips & Guidance | Examples |
|:---:|---|---|---|---|
| **10 min** | **Activador: El Sospechoso** | Teacher describes a "suspect" (a student in the room). Students must point to the person being described. | Use "Input Flood." Repeat the adjectives frequently. Focus on *alto/bajo* and *rubio/moreno*. | **T:** "Es un chico. Es bajo. Es moreno." <br>**C:** (Points to the student) |
| **12 min** | **Input: Gender Agreement (The 'O' and 'A' Rule)** | Use two characters (one male, one female). Show how the adjective changes: *Él es alto* vs. *Ella es alta*. | **Grammar Alert:** Use color-coding. Use blue for 'O' (masculine) and pink or red for 'A' (feminine) to help visual learners. | *"Paco es bajo. María es baja."* |
| **15 min** | **Task: ¿Quién es quién? (Interpersonal)** | Pair work. Each student has a set of mystery faces. They must describe their "secret person" until the partner guesses correctly. | **Live-Grade:** Listen for the vowel switch. If a boy says "Yo soy alta," gently point to a male student and say "Alto." | **A:** "¿Cómo es tu persona?" <br>**B:** "Es una chica. Es rubia y alta." |
| **8 min** | **Presentational: My Avatar** | Students draw a quick self-portrait and label it with three adjectives: *Yo soy...* | Check for consistency. The adjectives must match the student's gender identity. | *"Yo soy bajo, moreno y atlético."* |
| **5 min** | **Reflexional: The Power of 'Ser'** | Discuss why we use *Ser* for height but *Estar* (from Day 2) for feelings. (Permanent vs. Temporary). | Keep it simple. Height is "who you are" (Identity), feelings are "how you are" (State). | "Soy alto (Fixed) vs Estoy feliz (Temporary)." |

### 📘 Pedagogical Blueprint: How to Implement this Lesson
> *A guide for managing the introduction of Adjective Agreement.

**1. The "Default" Masculine:**
Explain to students that in Spanish, dictionaries usually show the masculine form first. They must be "Language Architects" and change the ending to 'A' if they are describing a female.

**2. Avoid the "Physical Critique":**
Keep descriptions light and positive. Focus on objective traits like height and hair color to ensure a safe classroom environment.

**3. Modeling the Guessing Game:**
Before Task 2, do a "Fishbowl" demo. Have one strong student come to the front and play a round with you so everyone sees the interaction pattern.

### 🚀 Differentiation & Enrichment

* **Support (Struggling):** Provide an "Agreement Cheat Sheet" (Boy = -o / Girl = -a) taped to their desks.
* **Enrichment (Achieving):** Challenge students to add "muy" or "un poco" to their descriptions (*Soy un poco bajo*).
