### 📌 Standards Leadership & Alignment

**National Standards Alignment (Primary)**
*Grounded in the frameworks of **ACTFL, NCSSFL, AATSP, and JNCL-NCLIS**.*
- **Communication – Interpersonal:** Exchange biographical information including age and birth dates.
- **Communication – Interpretive:** Recognize and decode numbers (0-31) and months of the year in spoken and written Spanish.
- **Cultures – Practices:** Analyze the cultural significance of birthdays and "coming of age" milestones across the Hispanic world.
- **Comparisons – Language:** Compare the linguistic structure of age (Spanish *Tener* vs. English *To Be*).

**NCSSFL-ACTFL Can-Do Statements**
> *I can count from 0 to 31 in Spanish to discuss dates and ages.*
> *I can state my age using the correct structure "Tengo... años."*
> *I can identify my birthday month and day in Spanish.*

**Missouri CLEs (Secondary Alignment)**
- FL.1.A.1 — Engage in simple conversations regarding personal biographical data.
- FL.4.A.1 — Contrast the grammatical structure of age across languages.

### 🎯 Lesson Objectives (UbD Backward Design)

**Enduring Understanding:** Numbers are the "data of identity." In Spanish, we don't "are" an age; we "have" years. This linguistic shift reflects a different perspective on life and time.

**Essential Question:** How does the way we express our age and our milestones define our place in a community?

### 📚 Vocabulary Focus: Numerical Identity

| Spanish | Category | English |
|---|---|---|
| **¿Cuántos años tienes?** | Question | How old are you? (How many years do you have?) |
| **Tengo... años** | Response | I am... years old (I have... years) |
| **¿Cuándo es tu cumple?** | Informal | When is your birthday? |
| **Números 0–31** | Logic | Counting / Calendar Days |
| **Meses del Año** | **Cognates** | Enero, Febrero, Marzo, Abril, Mayo... |

### 🌍 Cultural Spotlight: The Milestone of Age

Age is celebrated with unique intensity across the **21 Spanish-speaking countries**:

* **La Quinceañera:** In **Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean**, the 15th birthday is a major "rite of passage" for young women, symbolizing the transition from childhood to the community.
* **Birthday Rituals:** In many countries, the "Happy Birthday" song is followed by regional traditions, such as the *Mordida* in Mexico (face in the cake!) or the singing of *Las Mañanitas*.
* **The Date Format:** In almost every Spanish-speaking country, the date is written **Day/Month/Year**. This is a vital "Global Literacy" skill for traveling or filling out documents abroad.

### 🕐 Lesson Timeline (50 Minutes)

**Warm-Up: The "Number Pulse" (5 min)**
Teacher leads a rhythmic "call and response" counting 0-20. Use a clap on the "multiples of 5" to keep the energy high and the brain engaged.

**Input: The "I Have Years" CI Script (18 min)**
- Teacher models age: "I am not 30 years old. I *have* 30 years. [Mime holding something]. I have them in my pocket! *Tengo treinta años.*"
- Practice asking students *¿Cuántos años tienes?* and guiding them to use the number wall.
- Introduce the **Months of the Year**. Highlight that they are cognates—students already know them!

**Activity: The Birthday Line-Up (12 min)**
Students must organize themselves in a long line around the room in order of their birthday (January to December). **The Catch:** They can only speak Spanish. They must ask: *¿Cuándo es tu cumple?* and respond *Es el [número] de [mes].*

**Interactive Practice: Digital Bingo (10 min)**
A quick game of "Cumpleaños Bingo." Teacher calls out dates (e.g., *el doce de octubre*). Students mark their cards. This reinforces listening for both numbers and months simultaneously.

**Exit Ticket: The Identity Tag (5 min)**
Students write a 3-sentence profile:
1. *Me llamo [Nombre].*
2. *Tengo [Edad] años.*
3. *Mi cumple es el [Día] de [Mes].*

### 📺 Supplemental Resource Bank

> 🎬 **Watch:** Educators and students may visit the [Seño Bluemel Que Chévere YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvfq1AXJiDzXMV4VlA9ve_w?view_as=subscriber) for a video on "The Correct Way to State Your Age." This is essential for un-learning the common mistake of saying "Soy... años."

### 📝 Scaffolding & Differentiation
- **Scaffolding:** Provide a "Number Logic" sheet showing the patterns for 16-19 (*dieci-* + number) and 21-29 (*veinti-* + number).
- **Extension:** Students can research a specific birthday tradition from one of the 21 countries (e.g., *La Piñata* in Mexico or *El Tirón de Orejas* in Spain).
- **Visual Learners:** Color-code the months by season to help students associate *Marzo* with spring and *Octubre* with autumn.
