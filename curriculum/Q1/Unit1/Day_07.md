### 📌 Standards & Objectives

**ACTFL World-Readiness Standards (Primary)**
- **Communication – Interpersonal:** Ask and answer how someone is feeling using a range of emotional vocabulary.
- **Communication – Interpretive:** Identify emotional states from spoken input, images, and facial expressions.
- **Cultures – Perspectives:** Recognize that expressing emotion openly varies in degree and form across Spanish-speaking cultures.
- **Comparisons – Language:** Compare emotional expression in Spanish vs. English — noticing that Spanish has more granular vocabulary for well-being.

**NCSSFL-ACTFL Can-Do Statements**
> *I can say how I am feeling using words beyond* bien *and* mal.
> *I can ask someone how they feel and understand their response.*
> *I can recognize that emotional expression is culturally influenced.*

### 🎯 Lesson Objectives (UbD Backward Design)

**Enduring Understanding:** Language gives us words for feelings — and the words a culture chooses reveal what it values. Spanish has rich, specific ways of expressing emotional states that go far beyond "fine."

**Essential Question:** Why does it matter that you have more than one word for "okay"?

**Transfer Goal (toward Day 10 IPA):** Students will respond to *¿Cómo estás?* with a nuanced emotional response and ask a follow-up question in the Week 2 simulated Meet & Greet.

### 🌍 Cultural Spotlight: How Do Spanish Speakers Talk About Feelings?

**Colombia 🇨🇴** — Colombians are known for warmth and emotional expressiveness. *¿Cómo amaneció?* ("How did you wake up?" — literally "How did you dawn?") is a common greeting among adults, especially in Bogotá and Medellín, that goes deeper than just "How are you?" It signals genuine care for the other person's state.

**Mexico 🇲🇽** — Mexican Spanish has the colorful expression *estar de bajón* (to be in a slump/feeling down) or *estar en las nubes* (to have your head in the clouds — distracted). Emotional states in Mexican informal speech are often expressed metaphorically.

**Puerto Rico 🇵🇷** — In Puerto Rican Spanish, *¡Wepa!* is an exclamation of excitement or joy — an expression of being *emocionado/a* that has no single English equivalent. It's cultural vocabulary for a specific kind of happy energy.

**Argentina 🇦🇷** — Argentines are known for their rich emotional vocabulary, partly influenced by a strong psychoanalytic culture (Argentina has one of the highest rates of therapists per capita in the world). Talking about *how* you feel — in detail — is socially normal and valued.

**Classroom Connection:** Ask students — in English, when someone says "How are you?", do they actually want to know? In many Spanish-speaking cultures, the question carries more genuine weight. This is a cultural perspective shift worth sitting with.

### 🕐 Lesson Timeline (50 Minutes)

**Warm-Up / Activador (5 min)**
Teacher greets 5 students using full Week 1 + Day 6 sequence: greeting → name → origin. Students respond. Fast and energetic.

**Input: Teacher-Led CI Script (20 min)**

> *[Walk in looking exhausted — drag your feet, yawn, rub your eyes.]*
>
> "Buenos días, clase. [Pause. Yawn dramatically.] ¿Cómo estoy yo hoy? Cómo — how — estoy — I am. How am I today? Hmm. Estoy... cansada. [Sag your shoulders.] Cansada. Tired. Can-sa-da. I am tired. Estoy cansada."
>
> *[Write on board: Estoy + ___]*
>
> "Estoy. I am — right now, in this moment. Estoy cansada. Estoy bien. Estoy mal. Estoy emocionada. ESTOY. Watch my face — my cara — and guess the feeling."
>
> *[Act out: big smile → students guess* contento/a. *Sneezing, shivering → students guess* enfermo/a. *Running in place → students guess* ocupado/a.]*
>
> "¡Muy bien! Now — ¿cómo ESTÁS tú? [Point to student.] Tú — you. How are YOU? Tell me: Estoy ___. What's your word today? Think about it."
>
> *[Take 3–4 student responses. Write their words on the board.]*
>
> "Look at this board. [Gesture at the list.] Every person — different. Some are bien. Some are cansados. Someone is nervioso — nervous — maybe because it's Spanish class! [Laugh warmly.] That's okay. Nervioso is a real feeling. We have a word for it."
>
> *[Now model the full exchange.]*
>
> "¿Cómo estás? — Estoy bastante bien, gracias. ¿Y tú? — Regular. — ¿Por qué? — Estoy cansado. — ¡Ay, lo siento! — That means: I'm sorry to hear that."
>
> *[Introduce the cultural layer.]*
>
> "In Colombia — especially in Medellín — someone might ask you: ¿Cómo amaneció? How did you DAWN? How did you wake up? It's beautiful, right? Not just 'how are you' — but 'how did your day begin?' That's calidez. Warmth. They actually want to know."
>
> *[Pull out a flag image for Puerto Rico.]*
>
> "And in Puerto Rico — if you feel GREAT — if you're emocionado — you might say: ¡WEPA! [Pump your fist.] Wepa. It's joy. It's excitement. It doesn't translate. It's a cultural word. Puerto Rican energy. ¡WEPA!"
>
> *[Students say it with you. Laughing is good.]*
>
> "And in Argentina — they LOVE to talk about feelings. In detail. Argentina has more therapists per person than almost any country in the world. Talking about *how* you feel is completely normal. Respetable. Respected."

**Guided Practice: Emotion Charades (10 min)**
Students draw a vocabulary card from a stack (cansado/a, contento/a, nervioso/a, etc.). They act out the emotion — no words — while their partner guesses using *Estás ___*. Switch roles. Teacher calls time every 60 seconds.

**Partner Dialogue Practice (10 min)**
Full 6–8 line dialogue combining Week 1 and Week 2 vocabulary:
- Greeting → Name → Origin → *¿Cómo estás?* → Emotional response → *¿Por qué?* → One-word reason → Farewell

Students write the dialogue first, then perform it.

**Exit Ticket (5 min)**
On a notecard: Write *Estoy ___* with your honest feeling today. Then write one thing that surprised you about how another Spanish-speaking culture expresses emotion.

### 📝 Scaffolding & Differentiation Notes

- **Scaffolding:** Provide an emotion picture card set — images of faces + Spanish label — for students who need visual anchors.
- **Extension:** Students write a 5-sentence paragraph about a fictional day in the life of someone from Puerto Rico, using at least 4 emotion words.
- **Grammar Preview:** For students ready for more, note that *estoy* uses the verb *estar* — a special verb for temporary states. This is a seed for Unit 2 deep work.
