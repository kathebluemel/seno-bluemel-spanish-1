**Frameworks:** *ACTFL, NCSSFL-ACTFL, AATSP, JNCL-NCLIS, & Missouri CLEs*

| Domain | Focus & Standard Alignment |
|---|---|
| **Communication** | **Interpersonal:** Exchange biographical information including age and birth dates. *[ACTFL 1.1 / NCSSFL-ACTFL IC.N]* <br> **Interpretive:** Recognize and decode numbers (0-31) and months in spoken/written Spanish. *[ACTFL 1.2 / NCSSFL-ACTFL IR.N]* <br> **Presentational:** State personal age and birth date in a formal profile. *[ACTFL 1.3 / NCSSFL-ACTFL PS.N]* |
| **Cultures** | **Practices:** Analyze the significance of "coming of age" milestones (Quinceañera) and birthday rituals. *[ACTFL 2.1 / NCSSFL-ACTFL CUL.P]* |
| **Connections** | **Global Literacy:** Navigating the Day/Month/Year date format used in 21 countries. *[ACTFL 3.1 / JNCL-NCLIS]* |
| **Communities** | **Peer Connection:** Organizing the classroom community by chronological milestones. *[ACTFL 5.1 / AATSP]* |
| **Missouri CLEs** | **FL.1.A.1 / FL.4.A.1:** Simple conversations on biographical data; contrasting *Tener* vs. *To Be*. |

### 🎯 Learning Targets & Can-Do Statements
> *“Numbers are the data of identity. In Spanish, we don't 'are' an age; we 'have' years.”*

* **Learning Target:** I can communicate my age and birthday using the verb *Tener* and numbers 0–31.
* **Can-Do (Interpretive):** I can identify specific dates and ages when hearing them in a series.
* **Can-Do (Interpersonal):** I can ask peers for their birthday and collaborate to organize a chronological list.
* **Can-Do (Presentational):** I can write a 3-sentence identity tag including my name, age, and birthday.

### 📋 Activity Procedures & Teacher Guidance (Core Delivery)

| Time | Activity Title | Procedure & Instructional Details | Teacher Tips & Guidance | Examples |
|:---:|---|---|---|---|
| **5 min** | **Activador: The Number Pulse** | Rhythmic "call and response" counting 0-31. Use a clap on multiples of 5. | High energy is key here. It builds "Phonetic Muscle Memory" for the tricky 11-15 sequence. | **T:** "¡Cinco!" (Clap) <br>**C:** "¡Diez!" (Clap) |
| **18 min** | **Input: The "I Have Years" CI Script** | Model age: "I am not 30. I *have* 30 years. [Mime holding them]. *Tengo treinta años.*" Introduce months as cognates. | **Grammar Alert:** Strictly enforce *Tener*. Use your video link below to show students why "Soy... años" is a logic error. | *"Yo tengo catorce años. Mi cumple es el tres de mayo."* |
| **12 min** | **Task: The Birthday Line-Up (Interpersonal)** | Students must form a line around the room in order of birthday (Jan-Dec). **No English allowed.** | **Live-Grade:** Watch for the date format. Ensure they say *"el [número] de [mes]"* and not the English order. | **A:** "¿Cuándo es tu cumple?" <br>**B:** "Es el doce de octubre." |
| **10 min** | **Interactive: Cumpleaños Bingo** | Teacher calls out random dates (e.g., *el siete de agosto*). Students mark 3x3 grids. | This tests "Simultaneous Processing"—recognizing a number and a month at the same time. | **T:** "El veinte de enero." <br>**S:** (Marks 1/20) |
| **5 min** | **Reflexión: Global Date Formats** | Discuss the **Day/Month/Year** format. Why is this important for travel or legal documents? | Reinforce that 05/02 is February 5th in the Spanish-speaking world, not May 2nd. | "International literacy prevents missing your flight!" |

### 📊 ACTFL-Aligned Performance Rubric (4-Tier Formative)

| Criteria | **Exceeds (4)** | **Meets (3)** | **Approaching (2)** | **Below (1)** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Comprehensibility** | Flawless number pronunciation. Vowels in months are crisp. | Understood by someone used to learners. | Meaning is clear but relies on heavy English accent. | Incomprehensible; uses English numbers/months. |
| **Language Control** | Consistently uses *Tengo* and the *el [número] de [mes]* format. | Uses *Tengo* correctly. Minor errors in date order. | Uses "Soy" for age or omits "de" in dates. | Cannot form a sentence for age or date. |
| **Interpersonal Quality** | Fluidly negotiates the line-up without using English "filler." | Successfully communicates date to peers in the task. | Relies on showing their phone/paper instead of speaking. | Refuses to interact; speaks only English. |
| **Vocabulary Range** | Masters numbers 0-31 and all 12 months correctly. | Recognizes most numbers and months with minor hesitation. | Struggles with 11-15 and non-cognate months (Enero). | Cannot count to 10 or name 3 months. |

### 📘 Pedagogical Blueprint: How to Implement this Lesson
> *A guide for shifting from English logic to Spanish numerical identity.*

**1. Un-learning "I Am":**
Students will instinctively want to say "Soy 14." You must treat *Tener* as a "Possession of Experience." Use a physical prop (a box or bag) to represent "holding" your years.

**2. The Cognate Trap:**
Months like *Abril, Mayo, and Septiembre* are so close to English that students often mispronounce them with English vowels. Emphasize the **Spanish Vowels (A-E-I-O-U)** during the input phase.

**3. The Birthday Line-Up as Assessment:**
This is your "Chaos Management" check. If the line is accurate at the end of 12 minutes, the class has reached "Functional Fluency" for this objective.

### 🚀 Differentiation & Enrichment

* **Support (Struggling):** Provide a "Date Formula" card: *Es el [Number] de [Month].* * **Enrichment (Achieving):** Introduce the cultural milestone of the *Quinceañera* and ask them to calculate how many years until (or since) their own 15th birthday.
