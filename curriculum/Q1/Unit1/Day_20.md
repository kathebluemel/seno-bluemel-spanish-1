### 📌 Standards Leadership & Alignment
**Frameworks:** *ACTFL, NCSSFL, AATSP, JNCL-NCLIS, & Missouri CLEs*

| Domain | Focus & Standard Alignment |
|---|---|
| **Communication** | **Interpersonal:** Verify spelling/data (Names/Emails). **Interpretive:** Decode spelled audio. **Presentational:** Draft inventory maps. |
| **Cultures** | **Practices:** Navigate Hispanic naming conventions (doble apellido) in school databases. |
| **Connections** | **Administrative Literacy:** Applying alphabet mastery to real-world school registration tasks. |
| **Communities** | **Classroom Management:** Advocating for personal needs/supplies in the target language. |
| **Missouri CLEs** | **FL.1.A.1 / FL.4.A.1:** Using target language for school schedules; comparing phonetic consistency. |

### 🎯 Learning Targets & Can-Do Statements
> *“The alphabet is the DNA of the language; once mastered, the student gains autonomy.”*

* **Learning Target:** I can apply the Spanish alphabet and numbers 0–31 to solve administrative and organizational classroom tasks.
* **Can-Do (Interpretive):** I can recognize letters and numbers to understand spelled names and quantities in a school context.
* **Can-Do (Interpersonal):** I can ask for and provide classroom supplies and verify spelling to ensure accuracy.
* **Can-Do (Presentational):** I can label my surroundings and provide a phonetic guide for others to read them.

### 📋 Activity Procedures & Teacher Guidance



#### **Task 1: The Registrar's Data Entry (Interpretive)**
* **Procedure:** Act as a "School Registrar." Read 5 entries. State the name once, then spell it slowly letter-by-letter.
* **Teacher Tip:** Use names that test **"trap" letters**: *Jiménez* (J/G confusion), *Quiñones* (Q/U/Ñ mastery), or *Cevallos* (C/S/Z/V/B distinctions).
* **Check for Understanding:** Have students swap papers and correct with a red pen as you reveal the spelling on the board.

#### **Task 2: The Supply Closet (Interpersonal)**
* **Procedure:** Pair students. **Student A (Clerk)** has a visual shopping list (icons). **Student B (Manager)** has a blank inventory.
* **The Script:**
    * **A:** *"¿Me das tres lápices, por favor?"*
    * **B:** *"¿Cómo se escribe 'lápiz'?"*
    * **A:** *"Ele - á - pe - i - zeta."*
    * **B:** (Writes it down) *"Aquí tienes."* — **A:** *"Gracias."*
* **Teacher Tip:** Circulate to ensure the letter **"I"** is pronounced as "eee" and **"E"** as "ay."

#### **Task 3: The Phonetic Desk Map (Presentational)**
* **Procedure:** Students draw their workspace and label 5 items using **Un/Una**. Under each label, they write the *names* of the letters.
* **Example:** **UNA CARPETA** $\rightarrow$ *u - ene - a | ce - a - ere - pe - e - te - a*

### 📊 ACTFL-Aligned Performance Rubric (Formative)

| Performance Feature | Meets Expectations (Proficient) | Approaching (Developing) | Beginning (Emerging) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Language Control** | Distinct vowel sounds (A, E, I). Minimal English interference. | Vowels occasionally "code-switch" to English sounds (e.g., E sounds like E). | Relies on English letter names; communication breaks down. |
| **Interpersonal** | Fluid interaction. Uses *Por favor, Gracias, Aquí tienes*. | Transactional. Needs prompting for social courtesies. | Choppy; relies on isolated words rather than phrases. |
| **Accuracy** | Records data with 90-100% accuracy. | Records data with 70-80% accuracy; confuses G/J or C/S. | Accuracy below 60%; fails to recognize phonetic shifts. |

### 🕐 Lesson Timeline (50 Minutes)

1.  **Activador (0–5 min):** **Alphabet Volley.** Teacher says a letter; students shout the *next* letter in sequence.
2.  **Task 1 (5–17 min):** **The Registrar.** Students record 5 spelled names/quantities from teacher audio.
3.  **Task 2 (17–32 min):** **The Supply Closet.** Peer-to-peer role-play focused on requests and spelling verification.
4.  **Task 3 (32–45 min):** **The Phonetic Map.** Written/visual task creating phonetic labels for the desk area.
5.  **Reflexión (45–50 min):** **The "Tricky Letter" Poll.** Which letter name is hardest to remember?

---

### 🚀 Differentiation & Enrichment

* **Support (Struggling):** Provide a "Phonetic Anchor" card (e.g., A=ah, E=ay). For Task 1, provide the first and last letters of names as a scaffold.
* **Enrichment (Achieving):** Create a mock school email for Task 1 entries, spelling the symbols (*punto, arroba*). In Task 2, the Manager informs the Clerk they are "out of stock" to force a negotiation.
