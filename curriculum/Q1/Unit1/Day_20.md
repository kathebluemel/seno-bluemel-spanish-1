### 🎯 Learning Targets & Can-Do Statements
> *“The alphabet is the DNA of the language; once mastered, the student gains autonomy.”*

* **Learning Target:** I can apply the Spanish alphabet and numbers 0–31 to solve administrative and organizational classroom tasks.
* **Can-Do (Interpretive):** I can recognize letters and numbers to understand spelled names and quantities in a school context.
* **Can-Do (Interpersonal):** I can ask for and provide classroom supplies and verify spelling to ensure accuracy.
* **Can-Do (Presentational):** I can label my surroundings and provide a phonetic guide for others to read them.

### 📋 Activity Procedures & Teacher Guidance (Core Delivery)



| Time | Activity Title | Procedure & Instructional Details | Teacher Tips & Guidance | Examples |
|:---:|---|---|---|---|
| **5 min** | **Activador: El Voleibol de Letras** | Rapid-fire "Next Letter" drill. Teacher calls a letter; the class shouts the subsequent letter. Focus on vowel transitions (A-E-I). | Keep the tempo high. Do not stop for errors; simply repeat the correct letter and move on to maintain "flow." | **T:** "¡F!"<br>**C:** "¡G!"<br>**T:** "¡P!"<br>**C:** "¡Q!" |
| **12 min** | **Task 1: The Registrar (Interpretive)** | Students act as data entry clerks. Teacher "calls in" 5 new student registrations. Teacher says the name once, then spells it letter-by-letter. | Use "trap" letters like **H** (silent), **I** (sounds like E), and **E** (sounds like A). Emphasize the *doble apellido* structure. | *"Estudiante 1: Jiménez. Se escribe: jota, i, eme, é (con acento), ene, e, zeta."* |
| **18 min** | **Task 2: The Supply Closet (Interpersonal)** | Pair work. Partner A (Clerk) has a visual shopping list of icons. Partner B (Manager) has a blank inventory log. B must verify spelling before "releasing" supplies. | **Live-Grade:** Walk with your rubric. Listen for the "eee" sound for **I**. Ensure students say *"Gracias/De nada"* to meet cultural social markers. | **A:** "¿Me das dos carpetas?"<br>**B:** "¿Cómo se escribe?"<br>**A:** "ce-a-ere-pe-e-te-a."<br>**B:** "Aquí tienes." |
| **10 min** | **Task 3: The Phonetic Map (Presentational)** | Students sketch their immediate desk area and label 5 items using **Un/Una**. Below the label, they write the *names* of the letters used. | This bridges the gap between sound and written symbol. Check that they aren't just writing the word, but the letter names (e.g., 'ele-a' vs 'la'). | **Label:** Un bolígrafo.<br>**Phonetic:** u-ene | be-o-ele-í-ge-erre-a-efe-o. |
| **5 min** | **Reflexión: The Exit Poll** | Conduct a quick hands-up survey. "Which letter is the 'Sneakiest'?" (Most different from English). Use this to inform tomorrow's warm-up. | Use this data for differentiation. If many struggle with **G/J**, plan a 2-minute "minimal pair" drill for the start of Day 21. | "Raise your hand if **'E'** still tricks you into thinking it's **'A'**." |

### 📊 ACTFL-Aligned Performance Rubric (4-Tier Formative)

| Criteria | **Exceeds (4)** | **Meets (3)** | **Approaching (2)** | **Below (1)** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Comprehensibility** | Understood with ease by a native speaker. No English phonetic traces. | Understood by someone accustomed to language learners. | Meaning is often lost due to English vowel sounds. | Unintelligible; relies on English alphabet names. |
| **Language Control** | Perfect gender agreement (un/una). Correct use of accents. | Mostly correct gender. Minimal vowel "code-switching." | Frequent errors in gender. Vowels often default to English. | No gender agreement. Vowels are primarily English. |
| **Functional Literacy** | Completes all tasks with cultural nuances (e.g., doble apellido). | Completes all tasks with standard social markers. | Completes most tasks but lacks functional phrases. | Unable to complete tasks; requires constant teacher help. |
| **Communication Strategy** | Fluid, natural pace. Self-corrects pronunciation errors. | Steady pace. Maintains interaction with minimal hesitation. | Choppy; relies on isolated words and prompting. | Minimal interaction; communication constantly stalls. |

### 📘 Pedagogical Blueprint: How to Implement this IPA
> *A guide for teachers on using "Performance-Based Diagnostics."*



**1. Is this a Test?**
No. This is a **diagnostic performance day**. Students demonstrate their skills in real-time. The entire 50-minute period *is* the assessment. There is no "final quiz" at the end because the activities *are* the evidence.

**2. How to "Live-Grade":**
* **Task 1:** Collect the papers at the end of the 12 minutes. This is your "hard data" for listening comprehension.
* **Task 2:** This is the most important part for the teacher. **Do not sit at your desk.** Walk around with a clipboard and the rubric. Spend 60 seconds listening to one pair, mark their level (1, 2, 3, or 4), and move on. 
* **Task 3:** Collect these visual maps. They serve as "Portfolio Artifacts" that show the student's ability to bridge sounds to written spelling.

---

### 🚀 Differentiation & Enrichment

* **Support (Struggling):** Provide a desk-tent with "English-sound" approximations (e.g., I = "eee"). 
* **Enrichment (Achieving):** Add "administrative errors" (e.g., wrong spelling) for the student to identify and correct during the role-play.
