### 🎯 Learning Targets & Can-Do Statements

**Learning Targets:**
* **Numerical & Alphabetical Logic:** I can apply the Spanish alphabet and numbers 0–31 to solve administrative and organizational classroom tasks.
* **Functional Language:** I can use culturally appropriate formulas to request materials and verify information.

**ACTFL Can-Do Statements:**
* **Interpretive:** I can recognize the letters of the alphabet and numbers 1–31 to understand spelled names and quantities in a school context.
* **Interpersonal:** I can ask for and provide classroom supplies and verify spelling to ensure accuracy.
* **Presentational:** I can label my surroundings and provide a phonetic guide (spelling) for others to read them.

### 🕐 Lesson Timeline (50 Minutes)

| Time | Activity | Teacher Guidance |
|---|---|---|
| **0–5 min** | **Activador: El Alfabeto Musical** | Use a rhythmic beat. Teacher shouts a letter; students must shout the *next* letter in the sequence. |
| **5–15 min** | **Task 1: Interpretive — The Registrar** | Students act as "data entry clerks" listening to student names spelled out. |
| **15–30 min** | **Task 2: Interpersonal — The Supply Closet** | A peer-to-peer role-play focused on requests, numbers, and spelling verification. |
| **30–45 min** | **Task 3: Presentational — Desk Map** | A written/visual task creating a phonetic label system for the classroom. |
| **45–50 min** | **Reflexión y Cierre** | "The Tricky Letter" exit poll: Students identify the letter they found hardest to decode. |

### 📋 Activity Procedures & Teacher Guidance

#### **Activity 1: The Registrar's Data Entry (Interpretive)**
* **Procedure:** Teacher plays the role of a "School Registrar." Distribute a "Registration Form." Read 5 entries. For each, state the name once, then spell it slowly letter-by-letter.
* **The "Trap" Letters:** Include names with **H** (silent), **I** (sounds like English 'E'), **E** (sounds like English 'A'), and **G/J** (to test the 'h' sound).
* **Example:** *"Estudiante número dos: Apellido, Quiñones. Se escribe: Q (cu) - U (u) - I (i) - Ñ (eñe) - O (o) - N (ene) - E (e) - S (ese)."*
* **Teacher Tip:** Provide a "Correction Round" where students check their neighbor's spelling against the board at the very end to provide immediate feedback.

#### **Activity 2: The Supply Closet (Interpersonal)**
* **Procedure:** Students work in pairs. 
    * **Student A (Clerk):** Has a visual "shopping list" of icons (e.g., 3 pencils, 2 folders).
    * **Student B (Manager):** Has a blank inventory sheet.
* **The Exchange:**
    * **A:** *"¿Me das tres lápices, por favor?"*
    * **B:** *"¿Cómo se escribe 'lápiz'?"*
    * **A:** *"Ele - á - pe - i - zeta."*
    * **B:** (Writes it down, then mimes handing it over) *"Aquí tienes."*
    * **A:** *"Muchas gracias."*
* **Teacher Tip:** Circulate with a "Checklist of 5." Try to hear 5 different pairs pronounce the letter **"I"** correctly as "eee."

#### **Activity 3: The Phonetic Desk Map (Presentational)**
* **Procedure:** Students draw their immediate desk/workspace. They must label 5 items using the formula: **"Un/Una [Object]."** Below the label, they must write out the *names* of the letters as if they were spelling it aloud.
* **Example:** * **Label:** *Una carpeta* * **Phonetics:** *u - ene - a | ce - a - ere - pe - e - te - a*
* **Teacher Tip:** This allows you to see if students are confusing the *sounds* of the letters with the *names* of the letters.

### 📊 ACTFL-Aligned Performance Rubric (Formative)

| Performance Feature | **Meets Expectations (Proficient)** | **Approaching (Developing)** | **Beginning (Emerging)** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Language Control (Alphabet)** | Consistently identifies and produces Spanish letter names. Vowels (A, E, I) are distinct and accurate. | Mostly accurate, but English vowel sounds interfere (e.g., calling 'E' 'A'). | Relies heavily on English letter names; phonetic decoding is inconsistent. |
| **Interpersonal Quality** | Interaction is fluid. Uses cultural social markers (*Por favor, Gracias, Aquí tienes*). | Interaction is transactional. Manners are used but may require prompting. | Interaction is choppy; relies on single words rather than functional phrases. |
| **Interpretive Accuracy** | Records spelled names and quantities with 90-100% accuracy. | Records data with 70-80% accuracy; confuses G/J or C/S/Z. | Records data with less than 60% accuracy; fails to recognize vowel shifts. |
| **Orthography (Presentational)** | Labels are spelled correctly; includes accents (e.g., *bolígrafo*) in phonetic spelling. | Labels are recognizable, but accents or double letters (LL, RR) are omitted. | Labels are mostly misspelled or use English phonetics. |

### 🚀 Differentiation & Enrichment

#### **Support: For Students Struggling to Meet Targets**
* **The "Cheat Sheet" Anchor:** Provide a desk-tent with the alphabet and "sounds-like" English hints (e.g., **E** = **A**y).
* **Scaffolded Forms:** For Task 1, provide the "Registrar Form" with the first and last letters of each name already filled in.
* **Partial Tasking:** In Task 2, allow these students to focus on just 3 items instead of 5, emphasizing quality of pronunciation over quantity of words.

#### **Enrichment: For Students Achieving/Exceeding Targets**
* **The "Email Extension":** Ask students to create a school email for the names in Task 1, spelling out the symbols (e.g., *punto* for dot, *arroba* for @).
* **Inventory Conflict:** In Task 2, give the "Manager" a card that says "Out of Stock" for one item. The "Clerk" must then ask for a different item on the fly.
* **The Extra Letter:** Require these students to label 8 items and include at least two words with "special characters" like **Ñ** or words requiring an accent mark.

### 📝 Portfolio & Transition
* **Artifact:** The **Phonetic Desk Map** should be saved in the student portfolio to show growth in orthography.
* **Transition:** Now that they can navigate the *room*, we move to **Day 21**, where they start describing the *people* in the room using **Physical and Personality Descriptions**.
