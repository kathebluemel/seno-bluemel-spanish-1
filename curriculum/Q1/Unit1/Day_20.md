**Frameworks:** *ACTFL, NCSSFL-ACTFL, AATSP, JNCL-NCLIS, & Missouri CLEs*

| Domain | Focus & Standard Alignment |
|---|---|
| **Communication** | **Interpersonal:** Verify spelling/data (Names/Emails). *[ACTFL 1.1 / NCSSFL-ACTFL IC.I]* <br> **Interpretive:** Decode spelled audio and data. *[ACTFL 1.2 / NCSSFL-ACTFL IR.I]* <br> **Presentational:** Draft inventory maps/labels. *[ACTFL 1.3 / NCSSFL-ACTFL PS.I]* |
| **Cultures** | **Practices:** Navigate Hispanic naming conventions (doble apellido) in school databases. *[ACTFL 2.1 / NCSSFL-ACTFL CUL.P]* |
| **Connections** | **Administrative Literacy:** Applying alphabet mastery to real-world school registration tasks. *[ACTFL 3.1 / JNCL-NCLIS]* |
| **Communities** | **Classroom Management:** Advocating for personal needs/supplies in the target language. *[ACTFL 5.1 / AATSP]* |
| **Missouri CLEs** | **FL.1.A.1 / FL.4.A.1:** Using target language for school schedules; comparing phonetic consistency. |

### 🎯 Learning Targets & Can-Do Statements
> *“The alphabet is the DNA of the language; once mastered, the student gains autonomy.”*

* **Learning Target:** I can apply the Spanish alphabet and numbers 0–31 to solve administrative and organizational classroom tasks.
* **Can-Do (Interpretive):** I can recognize letters and numbers to understand spelled names and quantities in a school context.
* **Can-Do (Interpersonal):** I can ask for and provide classroom supplies and verify spelling to ensure accuracy.
* **Can-Do (Presentational):** I can label my surroundings and provide a phonetic guide for others to read them.

### 📋 Activity Procedures & Teacher Guidance



#### **Task 1: The Registrar's Data Entry (Interpretive)**
* **Procedure:** Teacher plays "Registrar." Read 5 student entries. Spell each name twice. 
* **Teacher Tip:** Focus on **phonetic interference** (e.g., *H* being silent, *E* sounding like English *A*). Use names like *Heredia, Guerrero, or Vizcaíno*.

#### **Task 2: The Supply Closet (Interpersonal)**
* **Procedure:** Partner A asks for supplies; Partner B verifies spelling before "distributing" them.
* **The Exchange:** *"¿Me das dos cuadernos?"* $\rightarrow$ *"¿Cómo se escribe 'cuaderno'?"* $\rightarrow$ *"ce-u-a-de-e-ere-ene-o."*

#### **Task 3: The Phonetic Desk Map (Presentational)**
* **Procedure:** Draw desk area. Label 5 items (un/una). Write the phonetic letter names underneath.
* **Example:** **UN LÁPIZ** $\rightarrow$ *u - ene | ele - á (con acento) - pe - i - zeta*

### 📊 ACTFL-Aligned Performance Rubric (4-Tier Formative)

| Criteria | **Exceeds (4)** | **Meets (3)** | **Approaching (2)** | **Below (1)** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Comprehensibility** | Understood with ease by a native speaker. No English phonetic traces. | Understood by someone accustomed to language learners. | Meaning is often lost due to English vowel sounds. | Unintelligible; relies on English alphabet names. |
| **Language Control** | Perfect gender agreement (un/una). Correct use of accents. | Mostly correct gender. Minimal vowel "code-switching." | Frequent errors in gender. Vowels often default to English. | No gender agreement. Vowels are primarily English. |
| **Functional Literacy** | Completes all tasks with cultural nuances (e.g., doble apellido). | Completes all tasks with standard social markers. | Completes most tasks but lacks functional phrases. | Unable to complete tasks; requires constant teacher help. |
| **Communication Strategy** | Fluid, natural pace. Self-corrects pronunciation errors. | Steady pace. Maintains interaction with minimal hesitation. | Choppy; relies on isolated words and prompting. | Minimal interaction; communication constantly stalls. |

### 🕐 Lesson Timeline (50 Minutes)

1.  **Activador (0–5 min):** **Alphabet Volley.** Rapid-fire letter naming to build automaticity.
2.  **Task 1 (5–17 min):** **The Registrar.** Interpretive spelling and numerical data entry.
3.  **Task 2 (17–32 min):** **The Supply Closet.** Interpersonal role-play focused on verification.
4.  **Task 3 (32–45 min):** **The Phonetic Map.** Bridging the gap between sound and written symbol.
5.  **Reflexión (45–50 min):** **The "Tricky Letter" Poll.** Gather data for Week 5 warm-ups.

---

### 🚀 Differentiation & Enrichment

* **Support (Struggling):** Provide a desk-tent with "English-sound" approximations (e.g., I = "eee"). 
* **Enrichment (Achieving):** Add "administrative errors" (e.g., wrong spelling) for the student to identify and correct during the role-play.

### 📘 Pedagogical Blueprint: How to Implement this IPA
> *A guide for teachers on using "Performance-Based Diagnostics."*



**1. Is this a Test?**
No. This is a **diagnostic performance day**. Students demonstrate their skills in real-time. The entire 50-minute period *is* the assessment. There is no "final quiz" at the end because the activities *are* the evidence.

**2. How to "Live-Grade":**
* **Task 1:** Collect the papers at the end of the 12 minutes. This is your "hard data" for listening comprehension.
* **Task 2:** This is the most important part for the teacher. **Do not sit at your desk.** Walk around with a clipboard and the rubric. Spend 60 seconds listening to one pair, mark their level (1, 2, 3, or 4), and move on. You should be able to "live-grade" the whole class in 15 minutes.
* **Task 3:** Collect these visual maps. They serve as "Portfolio Artifacts" that show the student's ability to bridge sounds to written spelling.

**3. Why use a Formative Rubric?**
Since this is Week 4, the data you collect today tells you what to fix in Week 5. If Task 1 results are low, you know the students haven't mastered vowel sounds yet, and you should delay the next topic until they do.
