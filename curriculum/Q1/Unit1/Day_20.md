### 📌 Standards Leadership & Alignment

**National Standards Alignment (Primary)**
*Grounded in the frameworks of **ACTFL, NCSSFL, AATSP, and JNCL-NCLIS**.*
- **Communication – Interpersonal:** Exchange and verify spelled information (names, emails) using the Spanish alphabet.
- **Communication – Interpretive:** Identify classroom objects and student data through spelled audio and written lists.
- **Communication – Presentational:** Draft a "Classroom Inventory" using accurate orthography and numerical counts.
- **Cultures – Practices:** Analyze the importance of the *doble apellido* (double surname) in school registration systems.
- **Comparisons – Language:** Contrast the phonetic consistency of the Spanish alphabet with the irregularities of English spelling.

**NCSSFL-ACTFL Can-Do Statements**
> *I can spell my name and other common words using the Spanish alphabet.*
> *I can identify classroom objects when I hear them spelled out letter-by-letter.*
> *I can request classroom materials using the formula "¿Me das un/una... por favor?".*

### 🎯 IPA Design Overview (UbD — Stage 1 Transfer)

**Enduring Understanding:** In a global school setting, spelling is a bridge to accuracy. Mastering the alphabet allows you to navigate administrative systems and advocate for your needs in the classroom.

**Essential Question:** How does mastering the "building blocks" of language (letters/numbers) empower a student in a new environment?

### 📋 IPA Task 2: Interpersonal — The Supply Closet (15 minutes)

**Scenario:** You and a partner are organizing the classroom supply closet. One student is the "Manager" and the other is the "Clerk."
* **Clerk:** Ask for specific items: *"¿Me das tres cuadernos y un lápiz, por favor?"*
* **Manager:** Ask for spelling to confirm: *"¿Cómo se escribe 'cuaderno'?"*
* **Clerk:** Spells the word using the Spanish alphabet.
* **Manager:** Hands over the item and says *"Aquí tienes."*
* **Clerk:** Reacts with *"Gracias."*

### 📋 IPA Task 3: Presentational — The Classroom Map (13 minutes)

**Task:** Create a visual "Label Map" of your desk area.
1. Draw 5 key objects (e.g., *mochila, papel, bolígrafo*).
2. Label them in Spanish.
3. Underneath the label, write the "Phonetic Spelling" of the word using Spanish letter names (e.g., **LÁPIZ** -> ele - á - pe - i - zeta).

### 📺 Supplemental Resource Bank

> 🎬 **Watch:** Educators and students may visit the [Seño Bluemel Que Chévere YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/@SenoBluemelQueChevere) for the "Alphabet & Classroom Objects" review video. Focus on the segment about the "Silent H" and the "Double L" to prep for the spelling tasks!

### 📝 Teacher Notes: Portfolio & Evolution
* **Portfolio Artifact #4:** The "Classroom Map" with phonetic labels.
* **Diagnostic Focus:** This IPA identifies students who are still "English-coding" their vowels (e.g., saying 'A' for 'E').
* **Unit 2 Evolution:** Next week (Week 5), we shift from the *objects* in the room to the *people*—introducing physical and personality descriptions!
