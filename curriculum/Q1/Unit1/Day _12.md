### 📌 Standards Leadership & Alignment

**National Standards Alignment (Primary)**
*Grounded in the frameworks of **ACTFL, NCSSFL, AATSP, and JNCL-NCLIS**.*
- **Communication – Interpersonal:** Use numbers 16–31 and days of the week to discuss schedules and dates.
- **Communication – Interpretive:** Identify the spelling shifts in compound numbers (16–29) vs. separate numbers (31+).
- **Cultures – Practices:** Analyze the **Monday-Start** calendar convention and its impact on the cultural perception of the "Weekend."
- **Comparisons – Language:** Discover the planetary roots (*Etymology*) of the days of the week and compare them to English/Norse origins.
- **Connections – Science:** Link Spanish vocabulary to the solar system (Luna, Marte, Mercurio, Júpiter, Venus).

**NCSSFL-ACTFL Can-Do Statements**
> *I can count from 16–31 and identify the written pattern for compound numbers.*
> *I can name the days of the week and explain why they are named after planets.*
> *I can identify "Lunes" as the start of the week in a Spanish-speaking context.*

**Missouri CLEs (Secondary Alignment)**
- FL.2.A.1 — Identify cultural differences in how time and the calendar week are structured.
- FL.4.A.1 — Compare calendar conventions between Spanish-speaking cultures and the U.S.

### 🎯 Lesson Objectives (UbD Backward Design)

**Enduring Understanding:** A calendar is more than a tool; it is a cultural map. From the planetary names of the days to the Monday start, how we track time reflects our history and our connection to the cosmos.

**Essential Question:** How does the organization of a calendar influence a culture's rhythm of life?

### 📚 Vocabulary Focus: The Celestial Week & Number Logic

**The Celestial Days:**


| Spanish | Celestial Root | English Hook |
|---|---|---|
| **Lunes** | Luna (Moon) | **Mon**-day |
| **Martes** | Marte (Mars) | Mars-day |
| **Miércoles** | Mercurio (Mercury) | Mercury-day |
| **Jueves** | Júpiter (Jupiter) | Jupiter-day |
| **Viernes** | Venus (Venus) | Venus-day |
| **Sábado** | Sabbath (Rest) | Saturday |
| **Domingo** | Dominus (Lord) | Sun-day |

**Number Logic (16–31):**
* **16–19:** Smash together (*Diez + y + seis = Dieciséis*). Note the accent on 16!
* **21–29:** Smash together (*Veinte + y + uno = Veintiuno*). 
* **31+:** Keep them separate (*Treinta y uno*).

### 🌍 Cultural Spotlight: The Rhythm of the Week

* **Monday First:** In the 21 Spanish-speaking countries, calendars begin on **Lunes**. The "Weekend" (*el fin de semana*) is seen as a cohesive unit of rest that concludes the week, rather than splitting it.
* **Equatorial Guinea 🇬🇶:** This African nation celebrates its independence on **October 12** (*el doce de octubre*). Knowing the numbers 1-31 is essential for understanding their national history.
* **The Andean Calendar (Peru/Bolivia):** While the 7-day week is standard, many indigenous communities still track time via agricultural "seasons" of planting and harvest, creating a layered experience of time.

### 🕐 Lesson Timeline (50 Minutes)

**Warm-Up: The Planet Match (5 min)**
Teacher writes the planets (Luna, Marte, Mercurio, Júpiter, Venus) on the board. Students must guess which Spanish days of the week match each planet.

**Input: The "Smash or Separate" Number Script (18 min)**
- Teacher models the spelling of 16-29. "These are fast! We smash them into one word: *Diecisiete! Veintidós!*"
- Contrast with 31. "This is too big to smash. We use three words: *Treinta y uno.*"
- Introduce the phrases: **Hoy es...** (Today is) and **Mañana es...** (Tomorrow is).

**Activity: The Human Calendar (12 min)**
Students are given cards with days (Lunes-Domingo) or numbers (1-31). They must organize themselves into a "Spanish Week" (Starting with Lunes) and a "Calendar Month," calling out their number/day as they find their spot.

**Interactive Practice: Planetary Bingo (10 min)**
A quick bingo game using days of the week and numbers 16-31. Teacher calls out "The day of Mars" (Martes) or "Three words: 31" (Treinta y uno).

**Exit Ticket: The Date Check (5 min)**
Write today's day and date in Spanish. Write tomorrow's day and date. Example: *Hoy es martes, el veintidós. Mañana es miércoles, el veintitrés.*

### 📺 Supplemental Resource Bank

> 🎬 **Watch:** Educators and students may visit the [Seño Bluemel Que Chévere YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvfq1AXJiDzXMV4VlA9ve_w?view_as=subscriber) for a video on the "Spelling Secrets of 16-31" and a fun mnemonic song for the days of the week. Perfect for perfecting that "Dieciséis" accent!

### 📝 Scaffolding & Differentiation
- **Scaffolding:** Provide a "Planetary Cheat Sheet" for the days of the week.
- **Extension:** Students can look up the "Saint's Day" (*El Santo*) for their birthday—a common tradition in Spain and Latin America where people celebrate the saint associated with their birth date.
- **Linguistic Logic:** Point out that in Spanish, days of the week and months are **not capitalized** (lunes, martes) unless they start a sentence. This is a key "Comparison" point with English!
