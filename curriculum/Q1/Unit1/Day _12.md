### 🎯 Lesson Objectives (UbD Backward Design)

**Enduring Understanding:** How a culture organizes its calendar — which day starts the week, which days are sacred, which numbers matter — reveals its values and history.

**Essential Question:** Does it matter which day you call "the first day of the week"?

**Transfer Goal (toward Day 15 IPA):** Students will use days of the week and numbers 16–31 to state and ask about birthdays in a full date expression: *Mi cumpleaños es el [number] de [month].*

### 📚 Vocabulary Focus

**Numbers 16–31:**

| Number | Spanish | Pattern Note |
|---|---|---|
| 16 | dieciséis | diez + y + seis (written as one word) |
| 17 | diecisiete | diez + y + siete |
| 18 | dieciocho | diez + y + ocho |
| 19 | diecinueve | diez + y + nueve |
| 20 | veinte | new root — memorize |
| 21 | veintiuno | veinte + y + uno (written as one word) |
| 22 | veintidós | veinte + y + dos |
| 23 | veintitrés | veinte + y + tres |
| 24 | veinticuatro | veinte + y + cuatro |
| 25 | veinticinco | veinte + y + cinco |
| 26 | veintiséis | veinte + y + seis |
| 27 | veintisiete | veinte + y + siete |
| 28 | veintiocho | veinte + y + ocho |
| 29 | veintinueve | veinte + y + nueve |
| 30 | treinta | new root — memorize |
| 31 | treinta y uno | treinta + y + uno (written as THREE words) |

**Pattern Alert:** 16–29 are compound words (one word). 31+ are separate words with *y* (and). This is a natural pattern students can decode.

**Days of the Week:**

| Spanish | English | Root/Memory Hook |
|---|---|---|
| lunes | Monday | *luna* — moon — Moon-day |
| martes | Tuesday | *Marte* — Mars — Mars-day |
| miércoles | Wednesday | *Mercurio* — Mercury |
| jueves | Thursday | *Júpiter* — Jupiter |
| viernes | Friday | *Venus* — Venus |
| sábado | Saturday | from *Sabbath* (Hebrew roots) |
| domingo | Sunday | *Dios/Dominus* — Lord's Day |

**New Structures:**
| Spanish | English |
|---|---|
| Hoy es ___ | Today is ___ |
| Mañana es ___ | Tomorrow is ___ |
| ¿Qué día es hoy? | What day is today? |
| el fin de semana | the weekend |
| entre semana | during the week (weekdays) |

### 🌍 Cultural Spotlight: The Week Starts on Monday

**The Calendar Difference:** In the United States, most calendars show **Sunday** as the first day of the week. In the Spanish-speaking world — and across most of Europe and Latin America — the week officially begins on **Monday** (*lunes*). This is not just a formatting choice; it reflects the cultural and religious framework in which the weekend (*sábado y domingo*) is seen as the rest period that *closes* the week, not opens it.

**Equatorial Guinea 🇬🇶** — As the only Spanish-speaking country in Africa, Equatorial Guinea's calendar culture blends Spanish Catholic tradition (Sunday as *Día del Señor* — the Lord's Day) with Fang and Bubi indigenous time-keeping practices. The country celebrates its **Independence Day on October 12** — *el doce de octubre* — which coincidentally shares the date with *El Día de la Hispanidad* observed across the Spanish-speaking world.

**Peru 🇵🇪** — In the Andean regions of Peru, the Quechua-speaking communities traditionally organized time around agricultural cycles — planting and harvest seasons — rather than a 7-day week. The Spanish colonial calendar was imposed but blended with indigenous time concepts. Today, Peruvian markets and festivals still follow both the Gregorian calendar and ancestral seasonal rhythms.

**Bolivia 🇧🇴** — Bolivia has **two capital cities** — Sucre (constitutional) and La Paz (seat of government) — and two official time zones. *¿Qué día es hoy?* can feel like a different question depending on which part of the country, which community, and which cultural tradition you're in. Time in Bolivia is layered.

**Missouri Connection 🇺🇸** — Ask students: "Does your phone or planner start the week on Sunday or Monday? Did you ever notice?" Many students haven't. This micro-observation opens a larger conversation about how culture shapes even the smallest daily structures.

### 🕐 Lesson Timeline (50 Minutes)

**Warm-Up / Activador: 0–15 Speed Review (5 min)**
Teacher points to students randomly and calls a number in English. Students say it in Spanish within 3 seconds. Then reverse — teacher says Spanish, students write the numeral. Quick, no-notes diagnostic.

**Input: Teacher-Led CI Script (18 min)**

> *[Write a large number 20 on the board.]*
>
> "Veinte. VEIN-te. Twenty. Veinte. This is a new word — new root. Not diez-something. VEINTE. Repeat — veinte."
>
> *[Students repeat. Now start building.]*
>
> "Veinte y uno — veintiuno. [Write it as one word.] See? Veinte + y + uno = veintiuno. One word. Veintidós. Veintitrés. The pattern continues — all the way to veintinueve. Twenty-nine. Then — TREINTA. [Write 30.] Treinta. New root again. Thirty."
>
> *[Write 31 on the board as: treinta y uno — three separate words.]*
>
> "Treinta y uno — THREE words. Why? Because 31 is too long to smash together. Thirty-one. Treinta. Y. Uno. ¿Lógico? Logical? Sí. Spanish has patterns. Find the patterns and Spanish becomes easy."
>
> *[Now pivot to days of the week — point to a wall calendar or draw one on the board.]*
>
> "Now — los días de la semana. The days of the WEEK. Semana — week. La semana. Watch the calendar — [point to the Monday column] — En español, la semana COMIENZA — begins — el LUNES. Monday. Not Sunday. LUNES."
>
> *[Point dramatically at any Sunday column.]*
>
> "Sunday — domingo — is the LAST day. El último día. In the Spanish-speaking world, domingo closes the week. It's the day of rest — el Día del Señor — the Lord's Day. And then? Lunes. Monday. Fresh start. Nueva semana."
>
> *[Now teach the planet memory hook — point to the sky.]*
>
> "These day names are NOT random. Look. LUNES — luna — la LUNA — the MOON. Moon-day. Monday. Same idea! MARTES — Marte — the planet MARS. In English — Tuesday comes from Tiw, the Norse god of war. Same planet, different mythology. MIÉRCOLES — Mercurio — Mercury. JUEVES — Júpiter — Jupiter. VIERNES — Venus. ¿Increíble, verdad? The planets are in your week."
>
> *[Students are usually genuinely surprised. Let it land.]*
>
> "And today — hoy — ¿qué día es HOY? [Point to calendar.] Hoy es [day]. And mañana — tomorrow — mañana es [next day]. ¿Y el fin de semana? The WEEKEND — sábado y domingo — comes at the END. El FIN de semana. The END of the week."

**Guided Practice: Calendar Activities (13 min)**

*Activity 1 — Days Chain (5 min):* Students sit in a circle. First student says *lunes.* Next says *martes.* Continue around the room. Second round: go backward. Third round: teacher calls a day — next student must say the following day without looking at notes.

*Activity 2 — Number + Day Combo (8 min):* Teacher displays 8 dates written as numbers (e.g., "el 21 — martes"). Students practice saying the full phrase: *El veintiuno es martes.* Then students write 5 dates of their own (upcoming school events, their birthday week) using the structures *Hoy es… / El ___ es…*

**Exit Ticket (4 min)**
Students write: (1) Today's date in Spanish (*Hoy es [day].* + the number of today's date). (2) Three consecutive days starting from today. (3) The number 27 and 31 written out in Spanish letters.

### 📺 Seño Bluemel Resource

> 🎬 **Watch:** Visit [youtube.com/@SenoBluemelQueChevere](https://youtube.com/@SenoBluemelQueChevere) for a days-of-the-week song or video — hearing the days in a rhythmic pattern dramatically accelerates memorization. Also look for any content on Latin American calendar traditions or holidays!

### 📝 Scaffolding & Differentiation Notes

- **Scaffolding:** Provide a printed week calendar with days in Spanish. Let students label it and keep it in their notebook as a reference anchor through Week 3.
- **Extension:** Students research what day of the week a major Spanish-speaking country's national holiday falls on this year and write: *El Día de la Independencia de [país] es el ___ de ___ . Este año es [día de la semana].*
- **IPA Connection:** Days of the week and numbers 16–31 are both essential for stating birthday dates in the Day 15 IPA.
