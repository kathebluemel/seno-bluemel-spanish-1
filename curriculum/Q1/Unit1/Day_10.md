### 🎯 IPA Design Overview (UbD — Stage 1 Transfer)

**Enduring Understanding:** Language is not just words — it is identity, relationship, and cultural intelligence. Knowing how to greet, introduce yourself, share your origin, and express your feelings in Spanish opens doors to 21 countries and over 500 million people.

**Essential Question:** Are you ready to connect with the Spanish-speaking world?

**Performance Tasks Today:**
1. **Interpretive Task** — Read a profile of a Spanish-speaking "visitor" and answer comprehension questions.
2. **Interpersonal Task** — Engage in a live, role-played conversation with the visitor (teacher or prepared partner).
3. **Presentational Task** — Write or deliver a brief introduction of yourself *and* your visitor for an imaginary "Welcome Assembly."

### 🌍 IPA Scenario: *¡El Gran Encuentro Internacional!*

**Student Prompt (read aloud and posted on board):**

> Your school's language department is hosting the **Grand International Meet & Greet** — a celebration of Spanish-speaking cultures from around the world. Exchange students from four different countries have arrived.
>
> Your job: Read about your assigned visitor, have a conversation with them, and then introduce both yourself and your visitor to the Welcome Assembly. Use everything you've learned in Weeks 1 and 2.

### 📋 IPA Task 1: Interpretive (10 minutes)

**Visitor Profile (Students receive one of four — teacher assigns or students select):**

---

**Profile A — Daniela Ríos Fuentes, Mexico City, Mexico 🇲🇽**
*Hola a todos. Me llamo Daniela Ríos Fuentes. Soy de la Ciudad de México — la ciudad más grande del mundo hispanohablante. Hoy estoy muy emocionada porque es mi primera vez en Missouri. Un poco nerviosa también, ¿la verdad? Pero estoy muy bien. En México, cuando estamos contentos, decimos: ¡Qué padre! ¡Y este intercambio es muy padre!*

---

**Profile B — Mateo Villanueva Sosa, San Juan, Puerto Rico 🇵🇷**
*¡Wepa! ¿Cómo están todos? Soy Mateo Villanueva Sosa. Soy de San Juan, Puerto Rico — ¡la isla del encanto! Puerto Rico es parte de los Estados Unidos, pero nuestra cultura y nuestro idioma son del Caribe. Hoy estoy bastante bien, pero también estoy cansado — el vuelo fue largo. Normally I'd say ¡Wepa! when I'm excited, and today — even tired — I am excited to be here.*

---

**Profile C — Valentina Pereyra Lagos, Buenos Aires, Argentina 🇦🇷**
*¡Buenas! Me llamo Valentina Pereyra Lagos. Soy de Buenos Aires, Argentina — una ciudad enorme y muy cultural. En Argentina usamos "vos" — no "tú." ¿Cómo andás? es nuestra forma de preguntar cómo estás. Hoy estoy muy contenta, un poco cansada del viaje, pero contenta. Buenos Aires tiene mucha energía — como yo.*

---

**Profile D — Señor Andrés Ospina Mora, Medellín, Colombia 🇨🇴**
*Buenos días. Me llamo Andrés Ospina Mora. Soy de Medellín, Colombia — la Ciudad de la Eterna Primavera. ¿Cómo amaneció? — así preguntamos en Colombia. Hoy estoy muy bien, gracias a Dios. Es un honor visitar Missouri. En Colombia valoramos mucho la calidez — la warmth — en cada conversación. Espero conocerlos a todos.*

---

**Interpretive Task Questions:**

1. What is the visitor's full name? What do you notice about the structure of their name?
2. Where are they from — country AND city?
3. How are they feeling today? Use at least two emotion words.
4. What regional expression do they use? What does it mean?
5. Is their profile written in a formal or informal register? How do you know?
6. Would you use *tú* or *usted* when speaking to this visitor? Why?

---

### 📋 IPA Task 2: Interpersonal (15 minutes)

**Format:** Student + teacher (or student + prepared partner using visitor role card). The visitor initiates with their region's greeting style. The student must respond and sustain the conversation.

**Student Must Accomplish (scored on IPA Rubric):**
- ✅ Respond to the visitor's opening greeting appropriately
- ✅ Exchange names (ask and share)
- ✅ Ask where the visitor is from and share their own origin
- ✅ Ask how the visitor is feeling and share their own emotional state
- ✅ Use correct register (formal or informal) consistently throughout
- ✅ Close the conversation with an appropriate farewell

**Visitor Role Card Prompts (teacher reference):**

> **Card A (Daniela / Mexico):** Open with *¡Hola! ¿Qué onda?* — informal, energetic. Use *tú*. Accept *¡Qué padre!* or *¡Chévere!* as cultural callouts.
>
> **Card B (Mateo / Puerto Rico):** Open with *¡Wepa! ¿Cómo estás?* — casual Caribbean energy. Use *tú*. React with *¡Wepa!* if student shares something positive.
>
> **Card C (Valentina / Argentina):** Open with *¡Buenas! ¿Cómo andás?* — use *vos* phrasing. Accept if student uses *tú* forms — they don't need to produce *vos*, only recognize it.
>
> **Card D (Señor Ospina / Colombia):** Open formally with *Buenos días. ¿Cómo está usted?* — formal throughout. Use *usted*. Accept *Que le vaya bien* as a farewell.

### 📝 Teacher Notes: Scoring, Portfolio & Next Steps

- This is a **formative** IPA — use rubric data to identify students needing re-teaching on register, *ser/estar*, or cultural vocabulary before Unit 2 begins.
- Collect Task 3 (Presentational writing) as the second portfolio artifact for Unit 1, alongside the Day 1 Desk Passport.
- Students who produce unprompted cultural callouts (*¡Wepa!, ¿Cómo amaneció?, vos* recognition) are ready for differentiated cultural depth tracks in Unit 2.
- **Unit 2 Preview:** Numbers, age (*¿Cuántos años tienes?*), and the alphabet — students will expand their interpersonal repertoire and begin working with *tener* as a new high-frequency verb.
