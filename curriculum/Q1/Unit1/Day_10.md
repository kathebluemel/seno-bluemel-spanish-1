### 📌 Standards Leadership & Alignment

**National Standards Alignment (Primary)**
*Grounded in the frameworks of **ACTFL, NCSSFL, AATSP, and JNCL-NCLIS**.*
- **Communication – Interpersonal:** Navigate a multi-turn conversation with a visitor, adjusting register and vocabulary to match their origin.
- **Communication – Interpretive:** Synthesize biographical and emotional data from diverse regional profiles (Mexico, PR, Argentina, Colombia).
- **Communication – Presentational:** Deliver a formal introduction that synthesizes personal and third-person data.
- **Cultures – Practices & Perspectives:** Demonstrate "Cultural Empathy" by using regional greetings and respecting naming conventions.
- **Comparisons – Language:** Correctly apply the *Ser vs. Estar* distinction in a real-world communicative context.

**NCSSFL-ACTFL Can-Do Statements**
> *I can interpret regional linguistic markers (Vos, Wepa, ¿Qué onda?) to identify a speaker's origin.*
> *I can maintain a socially appropriate conversation using the correct register (Tú/Usted).*
> *I can introduce a global citizen to a group, accurately describing their essence and current state.*

### 🎯 IPA Design Overview (UbD — Stage 1 Transfer)

**Enduring Understanding:** Communication is an act of identity. To connect with the 500 million speakers of Spanish, one must be able to listen for origin, respect formality, and share their own story.

**Essential Question:** How do I use my linguistic "toolkit" to build a bridge with someone from a different culture?

### 📋 IPA Task 1: Interpretive Reading (10 minutes)

Students are assigned **ONE** of the four "Global Visitor" profiles.

| Profile | Key Cultural Marker | Target Register |
|---|---|---|
| **Daniela (MX) 🇲🇽** | *¡Qué padre!* | Informal (*Tú*) |
| **Mateo (PR) 🇵🇷** | *¡Wepa!* / Island Identity | Informal (*Tú*) |
| **Valentina (AR) 🇦🇷** | *Voseo* (*¿Cómo andás?*) | Informal (*Vos*) |
| **Sr. Ospina (CO) 🇨🇴** | *¿Cómo amaneció?* / Formalism | Formal (*Usted*) |



---

### 📋 IPA Task 2: Interpersonal Role-Play (15 minutes)

**The Interaction:** Student meets the visitor (played by the teacher or a peer). 
* **The Challenge:** The visitor will use their regional greeting. The student must "code-switch" to match the energy and register of that visitor.
* **Success Criteria:** Greeting -> Name Ask/Share -> Origin Ask/Share -> Feeling Ask/Share -> Formal/Informal matching -> Cultural Farewell.

---

### 📋 IPA Task 3: Presentational Synthesis (10 minutes)

**The Prompt:** Write a **Formal Welcome Speech** (5–8 sentences) for the International Summit opening ceremony.
* **Requirements:** Introduce yourself (*Soy de... Estoy...*) and then introduce your visitor using third-person forms (*Es de... Está...*).
* **Cultural Goal:** Mention one regionalism you learned from your visitor's profile.

---

### 📊 Proficiency-Based Rubric (Summary)

* **Interpretive:** Accuracy in decoding name, origin, feeling, and regionalism.
* **Interpersonal:** Confidence, flow, and register consistency (Tú vs. Usted).
* **Presentational:** Accuracy of *Ser vs. Estar* and formal tone.
* **Cultural Literacy:** Recognition of regional variations and naming structures.

### 📝 Teacher Notes: The Portfolio Path
* **Formative Data:** Use the *Ser vs. Estar* scores to decide if Week 3 needs a "Verbo-Lab" intervention.
* **Artifacts:** Keep the Task 3 speeches for the student's **Language Growth Portfolio**.
* **Next Week:** We transition to **Numbers 0-100, Age (Tener), and the Alphabet** to build the next layer of identity.
