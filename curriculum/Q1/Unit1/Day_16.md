### 📌 Standards Leadership & Alignment

**National Standards Alignment (Primary)**
*Grounded in the pedagogical frameworks of **ACTFL, NCSSFL, AATSP, and JNCL-NCLIS**.*
- **Communication – Interpersonal:** Recycle greetings, name exchanges, origin questions, and emotional vocabulary in spontaneous, low-stakes communicative games.
- **Communication – Interpretive:** Process spoken and written input across all Unit 1 themes and respond accurately.
- **Cultures – Practices & Perspectives:** Revisit cultural greeting and emotional expression norms from across the 21 Spanish-speaking countries in contextualized review scenarios.
- **Comparisons – Language:** Consolidate understanding of formal vs. informal register, *ser* vs. *estar*, and regional vocabulary variation.

**NCSSFL-ACTFL Can-Do Statements**
> *I can greet, introduce myself, share my origin, and describe my feelings with increasing confidence and spontaneity.*
> *I can recognize vocabulary and cultural references from across the global Spanish-speaking world.*

**Missouri CLEs (Secondary Alignment)**
- FL.1.A.1 — Engage in simple conversations on familiar topics with growing fluency.
- FL.2.A.1 — Demonstrate cultural knowledge in communicative practice.

### 🎯 Lesson Objectives (UbD Backward Design)

**Enduring Understanding:** Fluency is the ability to use language flexibly and spontaneously in response to real human interaction. This review builds the confidence necessary for the upcoming Unit 1 IPA.

**Essential Question:** How can I use what I have learned to connect with people from different Spanish-speaking cultures?

**Transfer Goal:** Students will demonstrate unit-wide communicative competence across all three ACTFL modes in an authentic performance assessment (Days 18-20).

### 🌍 Cultural Spotlight: The 21 Countries — A Global Panorama

Today's review games are anchored to a diverse range of Spanish-speaking countries. **Instructional Note:** Ensure that prompts and examples represent a balance of regions (Central America, Caribbean, South America, Europe, and Africa) to maintain a global, inclusive perspective.

---

### 🕐 Lesson Timeline (50 Minutes)

**Warm-Up: ¿Quién soy? — Who Am I? (5 min)**
Each student enters to find a sticky note on their desk with the name of one of the 21 Spanish-speaking countries. Students must greet peers using a variety of greetings learned in this unit, acknowledging the diversity of the global Spanish-speaking community.

---

### 🎮 Review Game Rotation (38 minutes)

**Station 1 — ¡Bingo de Vocabulario!**
Teacher-facilitated bingo focusing on high-frequency structures and global cultural facts (e.g., "The only Spanish-speaking country in Africa").

**Station 2 — La Rueda de Conversación — Conversation Wheel**
Concentric circles for timed mini-conversations. Prompts include greeting a school principal (formal) vs. a peer (informal) and discussing origins from various countries.

**Station 3 — ¡Verdad o Mentira! — True or False?**
Fast-paced check of cultural facts (calendar start dates, date formats, and regional expressions like *¡Wepa!* or *¡Guay!*).

**Station 4 — El Mapa Humano — Human Map**
Kinesthetic activity where students move to different "continents" on the classroom floor based on the country called out, reinforcing geographic literacy.

### 📺 Supplemental Resource Bank

> 🎬 **Watch:** Educators and students may visit the [Seño Bluemel Que Chévere YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvfq1AXJiDzXMV4VlA9ve_w?view_as=subscriber) as a supplemental resource for Unit 1 review. The channel provides authentic audio-visual input to reinforce greetings, origins, and cultural segments explored in this unit.

---

### 📝 Scaffolding & Differentiation Notes
- **Scaffolding:** Provide visual "word walls" of the 21 countries to support the Human Map activity.
- **IPA Connection:** The end-of-class Can-Do checklist serves as a data point for the teacher to identify students needing targeted support before the final Unit 1 Assessment.
