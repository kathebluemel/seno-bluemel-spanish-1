### 📌 Standards & Objectives

**ACTFL World-Readiness Standards (Primary)**
- **Communication – Interpersonal:** Recycle greetings, name exchanges, origin questions, and emotional vocabulary in spontaneous, low-stakes communicative games.
- **Communication – Interpretive:** Process spoken and written input across all Unit 1 themes and respond accurately.
- **Cultures – Practices & Perspectives:** Revisit cultural greeting and emotional expression norms from across the Spanish-speaking world in contextualized review scenarios.
- **Comparisons – Language:** Consolidate understanding of formal vs. informal register, *ser* vs. *estar*, and regional vocabulary variation.

**NCSSFL-ACTFL Can-Do Statements**
> *I can greet, introduce myself, share my origin, and describe my feelings with increasing confidence and spontaneity.*
> *I can adjust my language — formal or informal — based on who I am speaking with.*
> *I can recognize vocabulary and cultural references from across the Spanish-speaking world.*

**Missouri CLEs (Secondary)**
- FL.1.A.1 — Engage in simple conversations on familiar topics with growing fluency.
- FL.2.A.1 — Demonstrate cultural knowledge in communicative practice.
- FL.4.A.1 — Apply comparative language knowledge in spontaneous exchanges.

### 🎯 Lesson Objectives (UbD Backward Design)

**Enduring Understanding:** Fluency is not memorization — it is the ability to use language flexibly, spontaneously, and in response to real human interaction. Review is not looking backward; it is building confidence for what comes next.

**Essential Question:** How do you know when you've truly *learned* something — and not just memorized it?

**Transfer Goal (toward Days 18–19 IPA):** Students will demonstrate unit-wide communicative competence across all three ACTFL modes in a high-quality, authentic performance assessment.

### 🌍 Cultural Spotlight: The 21 Countries — A Final Global Panorama

Today's cultural thread weaves through all six review games — each activity is anchored to a different Spanish-speaking country. Students end the day having touched all 21 nations as a preview to tomorrow's full country map activity.

**The 21 Spanish-Speaking Countries:**
Mexico 🇲🇽 · Guatemala 🇬🇹 · Honduras 🇭🇳 · El Salvador 🇸🇻 · Nicaragua 🇳🇮 · Costa Rica 🇨🇷 · Panama 🇵🇦 · Cuba 🇨🇺 · Dominican Republic 🇩🇴 · Puerto Rico 🇵🇷 · Venezuela 🇻🇪 · Colombia 🇨🇴 · Ecuador 🇪🇨 · Peru 🇵🇪 · Bolivia 🇧🇴 · Chile 🇨🇱 · Argentina 🇦🇷 · Uruguay 🇺🇾 · Paraguay 🇵🇾 · Spain 🇪🇸 · Equatorial Guinea 🇬🇶

**Teacher Note:** Post this list visibly throughout the review day. Reference a different country with each game transition. By the end of Day 17, every country should have been mentioned at least once.

---

### 🕐 Lesson Timeline (50 Minutes)

**Warm-Up: ¿Quién soy? — Who Am I? (5 min)**
Each student enters to find a sticky note on their desk with the name of a Spanish-speaking country. For the first 5 minutes, they must greet every person they interact with *as if they are from that country* — using the appropriate regional greeting. (*Buenas* for Argentina, *¿Qué onda?* for Mexico, *¡Wepa!* for Puerto Rico, *¿Cómo amaneció?* for Colombia, etc.) Energy should be high immediately.

---

### 🎮 Review Game Rotation (38 minutes — 4 stations, ~9 min each)

**Station 1 — ¡Bingo de Vocabulario! (Whole-Class Game, 9 min)**

Teacher-facilitated bingo using a 4×4 card with 16 Unit 1 vocabulary items (mix of Spanish words, English clues, and cultural references). Teacher calls clues in English or Spanish — students mark the Spanish term on their card.

*Sample clues:*
- *"The Colombian coastal way to say 'cool'"* → **¡Chévere!**
- *"How you ask a new friend their name"* → **¿Cómo te llamas?**
- *"The number after veintinueve"* → **treinta**
- *"The only Spanish-speaking country in Africa"* → **Guinea Ecuatorial**
- *"The formal farewell that means 'may things go well for you'"* → **Que le vaya bien**
- *"Tuesday's planet"* → **Marte**
- *"The verb for temporary states and feelings"* → **estar**

First student with 4 in a row calls *¡Bingo!* and must correctly say all 4 words aloud to win. Play 2 rounds.

---

**Station 2 — La Rueda de Conversación — Conversation Wheel (9 min)**

Students stand in two concentric circles — inner circle faces out, outer circle faces in, creating pairs. Each pair has 90 seconds to complete a mini-conversation using a prompt card drawn from a stack. Teacher calls *¡Gira!* (Rotate!) and the outer circle moves one person clockwise.

*Prompt card examples:*
- *"Greet your partner as if it's 8 AM. Exchange names. Say goodbye formally."*
- *"Ask your partner where they're from. Tell them you're from Guatemala. React with enthusiasm."*
- *"Ask how your partner is feeling. They say* estoy cansado/a. *Respond with empathy."*
- *"Ask your partner's birthday. Tell them yours. Wish them a happy birthday."*
- *"Use the vos greeting style — you're both from Argentina today."*
- *"Your partner is a school principal. Use formal register throughout."*

Students rotate through 4 different partners. Teacher circulates and notes strong performances for IPA encouragement.

**Station 3 — ¡Verdad o Mentira! — True or False? (9 min)**

Teacher reads a statement about Unit 1 content — cultural, grammatical, or vocabulary. Students hold up a green card (Verdad — True) or red card (Mentira — False). If false, they must correct it aloud.

*Sample statements:*
- *"In the Spanish-speaking world, calendars start on Sunday."* → **Mentira** — starts on Monday / lunes.
- *"¡Wepa! is a Puerto Rican expression of joy."* → **Verdad.**
- *"The date 08/03 means August 3rd in Colombia."* → **Mentira** — it means March 8th (DD/MM).
- *"Estoy nervioso uses the verb ser."* → **Mentira** — it uses *estar.*
- *"Vos is used instead of tú in Argentina and Uruguay."* → **Verdad.**
- *"Equatorial Guinea is in South America."* → **Mentira** — it's in Africa.
- *"Cumpleaños literally means 'the day you were born.'"* → **Mentira** — it means 'the years you fulfill.'
- *"The quinceañera celebrates a girl's 16th birthday."* → **Mentira** — it's the 15th / quince.
- *"Julio is named after Julius Caesar."* → **Verdad.**
- *"¿Cómo está usted? is the informal way to ask how someone is."* → **Mentira** — it's formal.

Move quickly. Aim for 12–15 statements. High energy, call on students who hold up the wrong card to correct themselves.

**Station 4 — El Mapa Humano — Human Map (9 min)**

Clear a space in the room. The floor becomes a map — teacher designates corners/areas as North America, South America, Europe, Africa, and the Caribbean. Teacher calls out a country in Spanish — students move to the correct geographic area of the room. Then teacher adds a language/cultural clue:

- *"Move to the country where people say ¿Cómo andás?"* → Argentina / Uruguay — South America
- *"Move to the country that is the only Spanish-speaking nation in Africa."* → Equatorial Guinea — Africa
- *"Move to the island that is both U.S. territory and Spanish-speaking Caribbean."* → Puerto Rico — Caribbean
- *"Move to the country where Las Mañanitas is sung at dawn on birthdays."* → Mexico — North America
- *"Move to the country where usted is used between friends as a sign of warmth."* → Colombia — South America
- *"Move to the country in Europe where they say ¡Guay!"* → Spain — Europe

Students discuss briefly with neighbors: *¿De dónde eres?* / *Soy de ___* using their assigned country. Keep it moving — 6–8 clues total.

### 📝 Scaffolding & Differentiation Notes

- **Scaffolding:** Allow students to keep their Self-Assessment Checklist out during Station 2 (conversation wheel) only — not during other stations.
- **Extension:** Students who mark all 8 items as *Sí* write a paragraph introducing a fictional Spanish-speaking student from a country not yet featured this unit, using all eight Can-Do competencies.
- **IPA Connection:** The Can-Do Checklist doubles as a pre-IPA self-assessment. Teacher reviews collected checklists tonight to identify students who need targeted check-ins before the Day 18 IPA.
