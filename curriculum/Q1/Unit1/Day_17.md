### 📌 Standards Leadership & Alignment

**National Standards Alignment (Primary)**
*Grounded in the pedagogical frameworks of **ACTFL, NCSSFL, AATSP, and JNCL-NCLIS**.*
- **Communication – Interpretive:** Identify Spanish-speaking countries on a map and associate them with specific cultural products or practices.
- **Communication – Presentational:** State where someone is from and describe their identity markers using third-person structures (*Es de...*, *Se llama...*).
- **Cultures – Products & Perspectives:** Demonstrate an understanding of the geographical vastness and cultural diversity of the 21 Spanish-speaking countries and territories.
- **Connections – Global Literacy:** Reinforce geographic knowledge by locating nations across four continents.

**NCSSFL-ACTFL Can-Do Statements**
> *I can identify all 21 Spanish-speaking countries on a world map.*
> *I can use the correct date format (DD/MM/YYYY) used in most Spanish-speaking nations.*
> *I can recognize that Spanish is a global language spoken in Europe, Africa, and the Americas.*

**Missouri CLEs (Secondary Alignment)**
- FL.2.A.1 — Identify countries where the target language is spoken.
- FL.3.A.1 — Connect Spanish learning to geographic and social studies knowledge.

### 🎯 Lesson Objectives (UbD Backward Design)

**Enduring Understanding:** Spanish is not just a language; it is a global bridge connecting 21 distinct nations. Knowing *where* the language is spoken is essential to understanding *who* speaks it.

**Essential Question:** How does geography influence the way people speak and identify themselves?

**Transfer Goal:** Students will use geographic and cultural literacy to complete the "Cultural Connection" portion of their Identity Passport IPA (Day 20).

### 🕐 Lesson Timeline (50 Minutes)

**Warm-Up: El Pasaporte Global (8 min)**
Students are given a "Mystery Identity" card representing a student from a Spanish-speaking country. They must find the country on a classroom map and write down one fact they remember about that region (e.g., "In Argentina, they use *vos*").

### 🗺️ Core Activity: The 21 Countries Deep-Dive (25 minutes)

**Instructional Strategy: Collaborative Mapping**
The teacher projects a blank world map. In small groups, students must work together to label all 21 Spanish-speaking countries. 

**Global Diversity Focus:**
The teacher rotates through groups, providing "Regional Clues" to help them find the harder-to-locate nations:
- *"Look for the only Spanish-speaking country in Africa (Equatorial Guinea)."*
- *"Find the largest island in the Caribbean (Cuba)."*
- *"Identify the long, skinny country on the western coast of South America (Chile)."*
- *"Find the country that connects North and South America (Panama)."*

### ✍️ Synthesis Activity: "Mi Conexión" (12 minutes)

Students choose **one** of the 21 countries that they find most interesting. They write 3 sentences in Spanish (scaffolded) about a student from that country:
1. *Se llama [Name].*
2. *Es de [Country].*
3. *Su cumpleaños es el [Date] de [Month].*

This activity serves as the "Rough Draft" for Section 2 of their final Identity Passport.

### 📺 Supplemental Resource Bank

> 🎬 **Watch:** Educators and students may visit the [Seño Bluemel Que Chévere YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvfq1AXJiDzXMV4VlA9ve_w?view_as=subscriber) for supplemental videos on the 21 Spanish-speaking countries. This is an excellent resource for students who want to see authentic footage of the countries they are researching for their IPA.

### 📝 Scaffolding & Differentiation Notes
- **Scaffolding:** Provide a word bank of the 21 countries for the mapping activity to support spelling and recognition.
- **Extension:** Students who finish early can research the flag of their chosen country or find one famous person (athlete, artist, or leader) from that nation to add to their "Mi Conexión" draft.
