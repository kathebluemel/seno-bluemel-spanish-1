### 🎯 Lesson Objectives (UbD Backward Design)

**Enduring Understanding:** The Spanish-speaking world is not a single place with a single culture — it is a mosaic of 21 nations, hundreds of regional identities, and over 500 million people. This unit has been a first glimpse at that mosaic.

**Essential Question:** What does it mean to be part of a global language community — and where do *you* fit in it?

**Transfer Goal (toward Days 18–19 IPA):** Students will be fully prepared to conduct a spontaneous interpersonal exchange with a new student, interpret a written cultural profile, and present a polished Identity Passport.

### 📚 Review Focus: Filling the Gaps

Based on Day 16 Self-Assessment data, today targets the most common *Todavía no* areas. The three most likely gaps heading into a Unit 1 IPA are:

1. **Number fluency 16–29** — compound form spelling and pronunciation
2. **Ser vs. estar** — students defaulting to only one verb
3. **Formal register sustained use** — sliding back to *tú* during *usted* scenarios

All three are threaded through today's activities.

### 🌍 Cultural Spotlight: Completing the Map — All 21 Countries

Today's lesson completes the unit's global journey. Every Spanish-speaking country gets named and placed. Use a large projected or printed world map throughout the period.

**Region by Region:**

**North America (1):** Mexico 🇲🇽

**Central America (6):** Guatemala 🇬🇹 · Honduras 🇭🇳 · El Salvador 🇸🇻 · Nicaragua 🇳🇮 · Costa Rica 🇨🇷 · Panama 🇵🇦

**The Caribbean (3):** Cuba 🇨🇺 · Dominican Republic 🇩🇴 · Puerto Rico 🇵🇷

**South America (9):** Venezuela 🇻🇪 · Colombia 🇨🇴 · Ecuador 🇪🇨 · Peru 🇵🇪 · Bolivia 🇧🇴 · Chile 🇨🇱 · Argentina 🇦🇷 · Uruguay 🇺🇾 · Paraguay 🇵🇾

**Europe (1):** Spain 🇪🇸

**Africa (1):** Equatorial Guinea 🇬🇶

**Fast Cultural Facts for Map Activity:**
- Costa Rica abolished its military in **1948** — *¡Paz!*
- Paraguay is one of only two **landlocked** countries in South America.
- Cuba has one of the highest **literacy rates** in the Western Hemisphere.
- Uruguay was the first Latin American country to legalize **same-sex marriage** (2013).
- Chile is the **longest country** in the world from north to south.
- The Dominican Republic shares the island of **Hispaniola** with Haiti — two countries, one island, two languages.

### 🕐 Lesson Timeline (50 Minutes)

**Warm-Up: 21 Countries Sprint (7 min)**
Students have 3 minutes to write down as many of the 21 Spanish-speaking countries as they can remember — no maps, no notes. Then reveal the full list. Class counts: Who got all 21? Who got 15+? Celebrate. Debrief the ones most commonly missed (Equatorial Guinea, Paraguay, and the smaller Central American nations).

**Activity 1 — Concurso de Números: Number Competition (8 min)**
Two students stand back to back at the front. Teacher calls a number in English (or shows it as a numeral). First student to correctly say it in Spanish wins and stays standing. Next challenger steps up. Move fast — 20+ rounds. Focus especially on the 16–29 compound forms that cause the most errors. Class keeps count of who wins the most rounds.

**Activity 2 — CI Script: The New Student Arrives (12 min)**

> *[Teacher sets the scene — pull a chair to the front and mime someone walking in nervously.]*
>
> "Clase — imaginen. Imagine. It's the first day of school. A new student — un nuevo estudiante — walks into class. They look nervous. Están nerviosos. [Make a nervous face.] They don't know anyone. Don't know the teacher. Don't know the school."
>
> *[Sit in the chair as the new student — look around uncertainly.]*
>
> "The teacher walks up. [Stand as teacher.] Buenos días. ¿Cómo se llama usted? — FORMAL. Because the teacher doesn't know this student yet. Respect. Register."
>
> *[Sit back as student.] — Me llamo Sofía. Soy de Costa Rica. [Stand as teacher.] ¡Bienvenida, Sofía! ¿Cuántos años tienes? [Sit as student.] Tengo quince años. [Stand as teacher.] ¡Mucho gusto! ¿Cuándo es tu cumpleaños? [Sit as student.] Mi cumpleaños es el tres de noviembre.*
>
> *[Step out of character.]*
>
> "¿Lo ven? See that conversation? That's your IPA. That's exactly what you'll do in two days. Someone walks in — new student — and you ask those exact questions. Greet. Name. Origin. Age. Birthday. Goodbye. The whole unit in one conversation."
>
> *[Now add the cultural layer.]*
>
> "But — Sofía is from Costa Rica. What do I know about Costa Rica? [Point to map.] Central America. They are famous for saying: ¡Pura vida! Pure life. It means everything — hello, goodbye, I'm fine, great, no worries. Pura vida. That's Costa Rican identity in two words."
>
> *[Write on board: ¡Pura vida! — Costa Rica 🇨🇷]*
>
> "The new student in your IPA will be from somewhere in the Spanish-speaking world. You don't choose — you adapt. You listen. You ask. You respond. That is communicative competence. That is what this unit has been building toward."

**Activity 3 — Identity Passport Draft Workshop (15 min)**
Students begin drafting their **Identity Passport** — the presentational artifact for the Day 19 IPA. Provide the passport template (see below). Students complete all sections in Spanish. Teacher circulates, gives feedback, and flags errors for self-correction.

**Identity Passport Template:**

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║         PASAPORTE DE IDENTIDAD               ║
║         Español 1 — Unit 1                   ║

║ Tengo _____________ años.                    ║

║ Hoy estoy __________________________________.║

║ ____________________________________________ ║
║                                              ║
║ Una cosa cultural que aprendí en la Unidad 1: ║
║ ____________________________________________ ║
║                                              ║
║ Mi saludo favorito: ________________________ ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

Students also write a **4–6 sentence self-introduction paragraph** on the back of the passport to be used as the presentational component of the Day 19 IPA.

**IPA Preview & Q&A (5 min)**
Explicitly walk through the Day 18–19 IPA structure:
- Day 18: Interpretive task (reading) + Interpersonal task (live conversation with new student)
- Day 19: Presentational task (Identity Passport finalization + delivery)

Answer student questions. Normalize anxiety — *Estoy nervioso/a es normal. Respira. Tú puedes.*

**Exit Ticket (3 min)**
Students write the one sentence they feel most confident saying in Spanish — and the one question they most want to be asked in the IPA. Teacher reads these quickly overnight to personalize IPA interactions where possible.

### 📺 Seño Bluemel Resource

> 🎬 **Watch:** Visit [youtube.com/@SenoBluemelQueChevere](https://youtube.com/@SenoBluemelQueChevere) tonight — do a final review run through any Unit 1 video that covers a weak area from your Self-Assessment Checklist. Then practice your passport introduction out loud at least three times before Day 18. Saying it aloud is the difference between knowing it and *owning* it.

### 📝 Scaffolding & Differentiation Notes

- **Scaffolding:** Provide a pre-filled Word Bank strip for students who need vocabulary support during the Passport Draft Workshop. The strip contains all key phrases but requires students to select and arrange them — not copy a complete sentence.
- **Extension:** Students add a second page to their passport: *Un día en mi vida en [chosen Spanish-speaking country]* — a 6-sentence creative paragraph imagining one day living in the country that most interests them.
- **IPA Connection:** The Identity Passport draft completed today becomes the working document for the Day 19 presentational IPA. Students should treat it as a real document — it goes into their Unit 1 portfolio.
