### 📌 Standards Leadership & Alignment

**National Standards Alignment (Primary)**
*Grounded in the pedagogical frameworks of **ACTFL, NCSSFL, AATSP, and JNCL-NCLIS**.*
- **Communication – Interpretive:** Read and listen to a short profile of a student from another country, extracting key personal information, cultural details, and date-format conventions.
- **Communication – Interpersonal:** Conduct a sustained, spontaneous, multi-topic conversation with an unfamiliar "new student," demonstrating register awareness, cultural responsiveness, and full Unit 1 vocabulary range.
- **Cultures – Practices & Perspectives:** Apply knowledge of greeting customs, emotional expression norms, date conventions, and birthday traditions from specific Spanish-speaking countries.
- **Comparisons – Language:** Demonstrate understanding of formal vs. informal register, *ser* vs. *estar*, and the DD/MM date format in real-time communication.

**NCSSFL-ACTFL Can-Do Statements**
> *I can read a short personal profile in Spanish and answer detailed comprehension questions.*
> *I can greet, introduce myself, and exchange biographical information in a natural, multi-turn conversation.*
> *I can adjust my language — formal or informal — based on contextual cues.*

**Missouri CLEs (Secondary Alignment)**
- FL.1.A.1 — Demonstrate sustained use of target language in multi-topic interpersonal communication.
- FL.2.A.1 — Apply cultural knowledge of Spanish-speaking countries in interpretive and interpersonal tasks.

### 🎯 IPA Design Overview (UbD — Stage 1 Transfer)

**Enduring Understanding:** Language learning is about being ready for the moment when a real person from another culture reaches out to connect. Today is that moment.

**Essential Question:** Are you prepared to welcome someone new into your community using their language and honoring their culture?

### 🌍 IPA Scenario: *¡Bienvenido/a al Salón! — Welcome to the Classroom!*

**Student Prompt:**
> A transfer student from a Spanish-speaking country has just enrolled at your school. Your job is to read their profile, understand who they are, and have a real conversation in Spanish that makes them feel welcome and seen.

### 📋 IPA Task 1: Interpretive — Reading (20 minutes)

*Teacher provides students with one of the four diverse profiles (Luciana/Peru, Emilio/Costa Rica, Amara/Equatorial Guinea, or Nicolás/Uruguay) to assess reading comprehension and cultural decoding.*

**Interpretive Task Questions:**
1. Identify the student's full name and paternal/maternal surnames.
2. Identify the city/country of origin and one geographical fact.
3. Write their birthday in full Spanish words and convert the DD/MM/YYYY format to the US format.
4. Describe their current emotional state using at least two terms from the text.
5. Identify one cultural tradition or value mentioned.
6. **Critical Thinking:** What is one question you would want to ask this student that goes beyond this unit's vocabulary?

### 📋 IPA Task 2: Interpersonal — Live Conversation (20 minutes)

**Format:** Spontaneous spoken conversation with the teacher (playing the "New Student"). 
**Goals:** Maintain a 9-point exchange including greetings, name exchange, origin, age, feelings, and a culturally responsive closing.

### 📝 Teacher Notes: IPA Administration
- **Holistic Observation:** Note which students demonstrate "Intercultural Empathy"—those who use welcoming phrases like *¡Bienvenida!* or *Mucho gusto*. 
- **Data Collection:** Use these scores to identify students who may need additional support with *ser vs. estar* or number recognition as we transition to Unit 2.
