### 📌 Standards Leadership & Alignment

**National Standards Alignment (Primary)**
*Grounded in the frameworks of **ACTFL, NCSSFL, AATSP, and JNCL-NCLIS**.*
- **Communication – Interpersonal:** Exchange full date information, including birthdays and cultural holidays.
- **Communication – Interpretive:** Decode numerical dates written in the Global Format (DD/MM/YYYY).
- **Cultures – Perspectives:** Analyze how different cultural perceptions of "Time Order" (Smallest-to-Largest) influence global documentation.
- **Comparisons – Language:** Evaluate the Latin roots of the months and compare the date formatting "logic" of English vs. Spanish.

**NCSSFL-ACTFL Can-Do Statements**
> *I can name the twelve months and identify their shared Latin roots with English.*
> *I can write a date in the "Day/Month/Year" format used by the Spanish-speaking world.*
> *I can identify my birthday and significant national holidays using the formula "el [número] de [mes]."*

**Missouri CLEs (Secondary Alignment)**
- FL.2.A.1 — Identify cultural conventions related to date formatting.
- FL.4.A.1 — Analyze potential for miscommunication caused by differing date conventions.

### 🎯 Lesson Objectives (UbD Backward Design)

**Enduring Understanding:** Cultural literacy is a protective skill. Misreading a date on a visa, a contract, or a medical form can have massive consequences. In Spanish, we move logically from the smallest unit (day) to the largest (year).

**Essential Question:** How can a simple slash (/) between numbers change the meaning of time?

### 📚 Vocabulary Focus: The Logic of the Months



| Spanish | Linguistic Origin | English Cognate |
|---|---|---|
| **Enero / Febrero** | Janus / Februa | January / February |
| **Marzo / Abril / Mayo** | Mars / Aphrodite / Maia | March / April / May |
| **Junio / Julio / Agosto** | Juno / Julius / Augustus | June / July / August |
| **Septiembre - Diciembre** | Septem (7) to Decem (10) | September - December |

**The Date Formula:**
* **Structure:** *el [número] de [mes]* (e.g., *el cinco de mayo*)
* **The Exception:** We say **el primero** (the first) instead of "el uno" for the 1st of any month.

### 🌍 Cultural Spotlight: The Global Date Conflict

* **The Visa Error:** Imagine a travel visa that expires on **10/03/2026**. An American traveler thinks they have until October. In Colombia or Spain, that visa expired on **March 10th**. Cultural awareness prevents legal trouble.
* **Equatorial Guinea 🇬🇶:** Their Independence Day is **12/10** (*el doce de octubre*). This day is a double celebration of national birth and Hispanic heritage.
* **Colombia 🇨🇴:** Independence is celebrated on **20/07** (*el veinte de julio*). Because there is no 20th month, this is often the moment American students realize the numbers are swapped!

### 🕐 Lesson Timeline (50 Minutes)

**Warm-Up: The Mystery Appointment (5 min)**
Teacher displays a doctor's appointment card: **"Cita Médica: 04/09."** Ask: *"If you are in Madrid, when do you go to the doctor?"* (September 4th). *"If you are in St. Louis?"* (April 9th). Discuss the impact of this 5-month difference.

**Input: The "Small-Medium-Large" Script (18 min)**
- Teacher uses a Russian nesting doll or different sized boxes to show logic. "In the U.S., we put the month first. In Spanish, we go in order: **Day (Small) -> Month (Medium) -> Year (Large).** It is logical!"
- Pronunciation practice for the 12 months. Focus on **Enero** (the outlier) and the **"pt"** in *Septiembre*.

**Activity: The Human Calendar (12 min)**
Students are given a famous date (e.g., 25/12, 04/07, 31/10). They must find their "Month Group" in the room by calling out: *¿Quién es de diciembre? ¿Quién es de julio?*

**Interactive Practice: Birthday Bingo (10 min)**
Students fill a 3x3 grid with dates (e.g., 12/01, 15/05). Teacher calls out dates in full Spanish: *"El quince de mayo."* Students must find the numerical match on their board.

**Exit Ticket: My Profile Update (5 min)**
Students write their name, their country (from Week 2), their age (from Day 11), and their birthday using the formula: *Mi cumpleaños es el [número] de [mes].*

### 📺 Supplemental Resource Bank

> 🎬 **Watch:** Educators and students may visit the [Seño Bluemel Que Chévere YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvfq1AXJiDzXMV4VlA9ve_w?view_as=subscriber) for a video on "The Real-World Risks of Date Formatting." This video clarifies the "Primero" rule and provides a rhythmic way to memorize the months!

### 📝 Scaffolding & Differentiation
- **Scaffolding:** Provide a visual "Day-Month-Year" arrow on the board as a permanent reference.
- **Extension:** Research "El Grito de Dolores" (Mexico) or "El Dieciocho" (Chile) and write the date in the global format.
- **Heritage Speakers:** Discuss how they write dates at home versus at school—do they find themselves "switching" between formats?
