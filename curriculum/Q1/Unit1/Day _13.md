### 📌 Standards & Objectives

**ACTFL World-Readiness Standards (Primary)**
- **Communication – Interpersonal:** Ask and state full dates including month, day, and year in spoken exchanges.
- **Communication – Interpretive:** Read and decode dates written in Spanish-speaking world format (DD/MM/YYYY) and convert them accurately.
- **Communication – Presentational:** Write today's full date in Spanish format and state it aloud.
- **Cultures – Practices & Perspectives:** Understand that date formatting conventions differ globally and that misreading a date can cause real-world miscommunication.
- **Comparisons – Language:** Compare the English MM/DD/YYYY format with the Spanish-speaking world's DD/MM/YYYY format and explain why they differ.

**NCSSFL-ACTFL Can-Do Statements**
> *I can name all twelve months of the year in Spanish.*
> *I can write and say a complete date using the Spanish-speaking world's format.*
> *I can explain why* 05/07 *means different things in the U.S. vs. Spain or Latin America.*

**Missouri CLEs (Secondary)**
- FL.1.A.1 — Use target language to communicate full date information.
- FL.2.A.1 — Identify cultural conventions related to date formatting across Spanish-speaking countries.
- FL.4.A.1 — Compare date conventions in Spanish vs. English and analyze potential for miscommunication.

### 🎯 Lesson Objectives (UbD Backward Design)

**Enduring Understanding:** Something as simple as writing a date can be misread across cultures — and that misreading has real consequences. Cultural awareness protects communication.

**Essential Question:** Could writing a date the "American way" cause a problem in a Spanish-speaking country?

**Transfer Goal (toward Day 15 IPA):** Students will state their full birthday date (*Mi cumpleaños es el [number] de [month]*) using Spanish date format conventions.

### 📚 Vocabulary Focus

**The Twelve Months:**

| Spanish | English | Cognate Note |
|---|---|---|
| enero | January | — |
| febrero | February | *February / febrero* — shared Latin root |
| marzo | March | *Mars / Marte / marzo* — the war god's month |
| abril | April | — |
| mayo | May | *Maia* — Roman goddess |
| junio | June | *Juno* — Roman goddess |
| julio | July | *Julius* Caesar's month |
| agosto | August | *Augustus* Caesar's month |
| septiembre | September | *septem* — seven (originally the 7th month) |
| octubre | October | *octo* — eight |
| noviembre | November | *novem* — nine |
| diciembre | December | *decem* — ten |

**Key Structures:**
| Spanish | English |
|---|---|
| ¿Cuál es la fecha de hoy? | What is today's date? |
| Hoy es el ___ de ___. | Today is the ___ of ___. |
| ¿Cuándo es tu cumpleaños? | When is your birthday? |
| Mi cumpleaños es el ___ de ___. | My birthday is the ___ of ___. |
| el primero de ___ | the first of ___ (special: use *primero*, not *uno*) |

**Date Format Rule:**
> 🇺🇸 **United States:** Month / Day / Year → **07/05/2025** = July 5th
> 🌎 **Spanish-speaking world:** Day / Month / Year → **05/07/2025** = July 5th
> ⚠️ **Same numbers. Completely different dates if misread.**

### 🌍 Cultural Spotlight: When Dates Aren't Just Numbers

**The Date Format Gap — A Real-World Consequence:**
When a Colombian business partner sends a contract dated **10/03/2025**, they mean **March 10th**. An American reader assumes **October 3rd**. Seven months of difference — on a legal document. This is not a hypothetical problem. It happens in immigration paperwork, medical records, travel visas, and international business every day. Teaching students to read DD/MM/YYYY is an act of genuine cultural and practical literacy.

**Equatorial Guinea 🇬🇶** — Equatorial Guinea celebrates its **National Independence Day on October 12** (*el doce de octubre*) — written in Spanish format as **12/10**. An American reader might assume December 10th. Written out in full — *el doce de octubre* — the confusion disappears entirely. This is why Spanish speakers often write dates in words for important documents.

**Peru 🇵🇪** — Peru's **Independence Day is July 28** (*el veintiocho de julio, 1821*) — a date every Peruvian child memorizes. Written numerically: **28/07/1821**. The month *julio* is named for Julius Caesar — a Roman emperor whose calendar reforms still shape how we measure time today. Peru's independence date connects ancient Rome, Spanish colonialism, and South American liberation in a single number.

**Bolivia 🇧🇴** — Bolivia actually celebrates **two independence days**: August 6 (*el seis de agosto*) as the date of independence in 1825, and later regional commemorations. A date like 06/08 written numerically would be read as June 8th in the U.S. but August 6th in Bolivia — the actual holiday date. Context and convention matter enormously.

**Colombia 🇨🇴** — Colombia's Independence Day is **July 20** (*el veinte de julio*). Written as 20/07. An American might read this as the 20th month — which doesn't exist — and realize something is wrong. This confusion is how many students first notice the format difference organically.

### 🕐 Lesson Timeline (50 Minutes)

**Warm-Up / Activador: The Mystery Date (5 min)**
Write **06/08** on the board. Ask: *"What date is this? Be specific — give me a month and a day."* Take answers. Students will likely say June 8th. Then reveal: *"In Bolivia, this is their Independence Day — August 6th. Same numbers. Different meaning. That's what we're learning today."*

**Input: Teacher-Led CI Script (18 min)**

> *[Point to the calendar on the wall — or a projected calendar.]*
>
> "Los meses del año. The months of the year. Doce meses — twelve months. Watch — many of these you already know. They're COGNATES."
>
> *[Point and say each month — students repeat. Go slow and deliberate on pronunciation.]*
>
> "Enero. Febrero. Marzo. Abril. Mayo. Junio. Julio. Agosto. Septiembre. Octubre. Noviembre. Diciembre."
>
> *[Now the etymology hook — students perk up with this.]*
>
> "¿Septiembre? Septem — SEVEN in Latin. Originally, septiembre WAS the seventh month. Then the Romans added January and February at the beginning and bumped everything. Octubre — octo — EIGHT. Noviembre — novem — NINE. Diciembre — decem — TEN. Spanish kept the Latin names. English did too! September. October. November. December. Same roots."
>
> *[Write julio and agosto on the board.]*
>
> "Julio — JULIO CÉSAR. Julius Caesar. He was so powerful they named a MONTH after him. July. Julio. Agosto — AUGUSTO. Emperor Augustus. August. Agosto. These emperors have been in your calendar for 2,000 years."
>
> *[Now the date format — use the mystery date from the warm-up.]*
>
> "Okay — la fecha. The date. In the United States, we say MONTH first. July fifth — 7/5. Month, day. ¿Sí? But in Spanish — in Colombia, in Peru, in Bolivia, in Spain, in Equatorial Guinea — we say the DAY first. El cinco de julio — the fifth of July — written as 5/7. Day. Month."
>
> *[Write side by side on board:]*
> *🇺🇸 07/05 = July 5th*
> *🌎 07/05 = May 7th*
>
> "SAME NUMBERS. Different countries. Different meaning. If I send you a letter and write 10/03 — and you're American — you read October 3rd. If I'm Colombian, I wrote March 10th. ¿Problema? Yes. BIG problem."
>
> *[Introduce the full date structure.]*
>
> "In Spanish — we say it the logical way: [hold up fingers] — el [day] de [month]. El cinco de julio. El veinte de enero. El primero de marzo — PRIMERO — not uno — for the FIRST day of a month. Primero. Special rule."
>
> *[Practice together.]*
>
> "Hoy es el ___ de ___. [Fill in today's real date.] ¿Cuándo es tu cumpleaños? Mi cumpleaños es el ___ de ___. That's your sentence for this week. Mi cumpleaños es el ___ de ___."

**Guided Practice: Date Detectives (12 min)**

*Activity 1 — Decode the Date (6 min):* Students receive a card with 6 dates written numerically (e.g., 15/04, 28/07, 01/11). They write out each date in full Spanish format (*el quince de abril, el veintiocho de julio, el primero de noviembre*).

*Activity 2 — Holiday Match (6 min):* Students match 5 famous Spanish-speaking-world dates (independence days, cultural holidays) to the correct country using clues from today's cultural spotlight. Written in full Spanish date format.

**Partner Practice: Birthday Exchange (8 min)**
Partners ask each other: *¿Cuándo es tu cumpleaños? — Mi cumpleaños es el ___ de ___.* Each writes their partner's birthday in full Spanish format. Then: compare — are any birthdays in the same month? Same week?

**Exit Ticket (4 min)**
Students write today's full date in two formats: (1) American format in English and (2) Spanish-speaking world format in full Spanish words (*el ___ de ___, 20___*). Then answer: *¿Por qué importa el formato de la fecha?* (Why does date format matter?) — one sentence in English is fine.

### 📝 Scaffolding & Differentiation Notes

- **Scaffolding:** Provide a month reference card with the Spanish month, English equivalent, and the cognate/etymology note. Students keep this in their Week 3 folder.
- **Extension:** Students research one national holiday from a Spanish-speaking country not covered today, write the full date in Spanish format, and explain what the holiday celebrates.
- **Real-World Literacy:** Emphasize to students that the date format difference is *not* a trivia fact — it is a practical life skill for anyone who interacts with Spanish-speaking colleagues, neighbors, or institutions.
