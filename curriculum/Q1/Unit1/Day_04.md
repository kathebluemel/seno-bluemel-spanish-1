### 📌 Standards Leadership & Alignment

**National Standards Alignment (Primary)**
*Grounded in the pedagogical frameworks of **ACTFL, NCSSFL, AATSP, and JNCL-NCLIS**.*
- **Communication – Interpersonal:** Navigate simple conversations using appropriate formal or informal registers based on social cues.
- **Cultures – Practices & Perspectives:** Analyze how social hierarchy, age, and relationship determine language register across 21 Spanish-speaking cultures.
- **Comparisons – Language:** Compare the explicit register markers in Spanish (*tú/usted/vos*) with the implicit markers used in English (titles, tone, word choice).

**NCSSFL-ACTFL Can-Do Statements**
> *I can identify whether a conversation is formal or informal based on linguistic markers.*
> *I can greeting someone, exchange names, and conclude a conversation using the register appropriate to the social context.*

**Missouri CLEs (Secondary Alignment)**
- FL.1.A.1 – Engage in simple conversations on familiar topics.
- FL.4.A.1 – Demonstrate understanding of the concept of register in language use.

### 🎯 Lesson Objectives (UbD Backward Design)

**Enduring Understanding:** Language is not one-size-fits-all. Skilled global citizens adapt their speech to show respect and build rapport according to cultural norms.

**Essential Question:** How do I choose the right "version" of Spanish to honor the person I am speaking with?

### 📚 Vocabulary Synthesis: The Register Map



| Context | Informal (Tú / Vos) | Formal (Usted) |
|---|---|---|
| **Identity** | ¿Cómo te llamas? | ¿Cómo se llama usted? |
| **Well-being** | ¿Cómo estás? | ¿Cómo está usted? |
| **Response** | ¿Y tú? / ¿Y vos? | ¿Y usted? |
| **Greeting** | ¡Hola! | Buenos días/tardes/noches |
| **Farewell** | ¡Chao! / ¡Nos vemos! | Hasta luego / Que le vaya bien |

### 🌍 Cultural Spotlight: The Spectrum of Formality

The 21 Spanish-speaking countries utilize register in nuanced, fascinating ways:

* **The Colombian Exception:** In many regions of **Colombia**, *usted* is used between close friends and family to signal warmth and deep respect. It is not "cold"; it is a linguistic embrace.
* **The Southern Cone (Argentina/Uruguay):** *Vos* is the standard informal "you." Using it is a marker of regional pride and authenticity.
* **The "Usted" of Respect:** Across most of the Spanish-speaking world, *usted* is used with elders, teachers, medical professionals, and strangers. It is a "social shield" of courtesy.

### 🕐 Lesson Timeline (50 Minutes)

**Warm-Up: Sociolinguistic Sorting (8 min)**
Teacher displays images of various pairs (Two teenagers, a student and a police officer, two grandparents, a doctor and patient). Students hold up a "T" (Tú/Vos) or "U" (Usted) card to decide which register fits.

**Input: The "Mirror Dialogue" (15 min)**
Teacher performs two identical interactions with different "energy":
- **Scene A (Professional):** Meeting a global ambassador. Focus on *Se llama*, *Usted*, and the formal farewell *Que le vaya bien*.
- **Scene B (Peer-to-Peer):** Meeting a new friend at a soccer match. Focus on *Te llamas*, *Tú*, and the informal *¡Chao!* or *¡Nos vemos!*
- Teacher notes: "The goal isn't just to be 'right'—it's to be **culturally responsive**."

**Guided Practice: Register Role-Play (15 min)**
Partners receive "Identity Cards" (e.g., "You are a reporter from Spain," "You are a student from Mexico"). They must perform a 4-line introduction using the correct register for their assigned roles.

**Activity: "Que le vaya bien" vs. "Chao" (7 min)**
Class practices the "Formal Bow" for *usted* farewells and the "Casual Wave" for *chao*. This kinesthetic association helps cement the register difference.

**Exit Ticket: The Register Check (5 min)**
Write one formal introduction sentence and one informal introduction sentence. Circle the words that "changed" between the two.

> 🎬 **Watch:** Educators and students may visit the [Seño Bluemel Que Chévere YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvfq1AXJiDzXMV4VlA9ve_w?view_as=subscriber) for a deep dive into the *Tú vs. Usted* distinction and a specific look at the *Vos* pronoun used in the Southern Cone.

### 📝 Scaffolding & Differentiation
- **Scaffolding:** Provide a "Register Cheat Sheet" with the specific verb endings highlighted (e.g., *está**s*** vs. *está*).
- **Extension:** Research a country where *voseo* (using *vos*) is prominent and explain its history.
- **IPA Connection:** This lesson serves as the final rehearsal for the Day 5 Formative Assessment.
