### 🎯 Learning Targets & Can-Do Statements
> **Essential Question:** Why is "Where are you from?" one of the most important questions you can ask in a global community?

* **Enduring Understanding:** Spanish is a global passport; knowing where someone is from provides immediate context for their culture, dialect, and perspective.
* **Can-Do (Interpersonal):** I can ask a peer *¿De dónde eres?* and respond with *Yo soy de...*
* **Can-Do (Interpretive):** I can locate at least five Spanish-speaking countries on a map when I hear their names.
* **Can-Do (Presentational):** I can state where I am from and where my teacher is from.

### 🌍 Cultural Spotlight: The 21 Faces of Spanish



* **The Big Picture:** Spanish is the official language of **21 countries**. It isn't just "Latin American"—it is European (Spain) and African (Equatorial Guinea).
* **The "Home" Connection 🇨🇴:** Seño Bluemel is from **Colombia**. When someone asks her *¿De dónde es usted?*, she answers *Yo soy de Colombia*. 
* **The Missouri Identity 🇺🇸:** Most students in this class will answer *Yo soy de los Estados Unidos* or *Yo soy de Missouri*. 
* **Regional Pride:** In the Spanish-speaking world, people often identify strongly with their specific city or province before their country (e.g., "I am *Barranquillera*" before "I am Colombian").

### 📋 Activity Procedures & Teacher Guidance (Core Delivery)

| Time | Activity Title | Procedure & Instructional Details | Teacher Tips & Guidance | Examples |
|:---:|---|---|---|---|
| **7 min** | **Warm-Up: Name Tag Blitz** | Review Day 3. Students walk around and find 3 people. They must exchange names and a time-based greeting. | Use music (Cumbia or Reggaetón) to keep the energy high. | *"¡Buenas! ¿Cómo te llamas?"* |
| **15 min** | **Input: Teacher CI Script** | Deliver the **Origin & Geography** script. Point to the world map constantly. | Emphasize the word "DE" (from). Mime a line coming from a country to your heart. | *"Yo soy DE Colombia."* |
| **13 min** | **Task: Map Labeling** | Students receive a blank map. As the teacher calls out 10 specific countries, students color them in. | Focus on the "Big 4": Spain, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina. |  *"Busca México. Colorea México verde."* |
| **10 min** | **Pair Work: Global Interviews** | Pairs practice: *¿De dónde eres?* → *Yo soy de [City/State].* Then they ask about the teacher: *¿De dónde es la Seño?* | Ensure they use "es" for the teacher and "soy" for themselves. | *"Ella es de Colombia."* |
| **5 min** | **Exit Ticket: Passport Stamp** | Students must tell the teacher one country (besides the US/Mexico) where Spanish is spoken. | Don't let them repeat a country that was just said by a peer. | **S:** "Costa Rica." <br> **T:** "¡Excelente! Adiós." |

### 📘 Pedagogical Blueprint: How to Implement this Lesson

**1. The "De" Anchor:**
Students often forget the preposition "de." Use a physical anchor: every time you say "de," touch your chest and then point away, as if showing a path from your origin to where you are now.

**2. Geography as Context:**
Don't just teach the list of 21 countries; teach their *neighbors*. Knowing that Spain is in Europe while Colombia is in South America helps students understand why their accents and "cool" words (*Guay* vs. *Chévere*) are different.

**3. Script for the Teacher (CI Model):**
> *[Stand by the world map. Point to Missouri.]*
> "Clase, nosotros estamos aquí. Missouri. En los Estados Unidos. Pero... **¿De dónde eres tú?** De—from. Dónde—where. Eres—you are. [Point to a student] Ben, ¿de dónde eres tú? [Help them: Yo soy de Missouri]. ¡Excelente! 
> 
> [Point to Colombia] **Yo soy de Colombia.** Yo no soy de Missouri. Yo soy de Colombia. [Point to Spain] Mi amigo es de España. Es un mundo grande. Hay **21 países** que hablan español. ¡Es fantástico!"

### 🚀 Differentiation & Enrichment

* **Support (Struggling):** Provide a map with the first letter of each country already provided as a scaffold.
* **Enrichment (Achieving):** Challenge students to name the capital cities of the "Big 4" countries (Madrid, CDMX, Bogotá, Buenos Aires).
* **Heritage Speakers:** Ask them to share specifically which city or state their family is from (e.g., "Yo soy de Michoacán, México").
* **ELL Support:** Use the cognate "Continente" and "Mapa" to bridge the geography activity instructions.
