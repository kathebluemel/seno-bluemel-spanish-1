# Quarter 1 | Unit 1 | Day 4
## Putting It All Together: Formal vs. Informal Registers in Context

---

### 📌 Standards & Objectives

**ACTFL World-Readiness Standards (Primary)**
- **Communication – Interpersonal:** Navigate a simple conversation using appropriate formal or informal register.
- **Cultures – Practices & Perspectives:** Analyze how social context determines language register across Spanish-speaking cultures.
- **Comparisons – Language:** Compare how formality works in Spanish (tú/usted; vos) vs. English.

**NCSSFL-ACTFL Can-Do Statements**
> *I can greet someone, exchange names, and say goodbye using language appropriate to the situation (formal or informal).*
> *I can identify whether a conversation is formal or informal based on the words used.*

**Missouri CLEs (Secondary)**
- FL.1.A.1 – Engage in simple conversations on familiar topics.
- FL.2.A.1 – Identify practices and products of target cultures.
- FL.4.A.1 – Demonstrate understanding of the concept of register in language use.

### 🎯 Lesson Objectives (UbD Backward Design)

**Enduring Understanding:** Language is not one-size-fits-all — skilled communicators choose words based on who they are talking to and why.

**Essential Question:** How do you know which "version" of Spanish to use — and what happens if you use the wrong one?

**Transfer Goal (toward Day 5 IPA):** Students will independently select formal or informal language for a greeting scenario with a "global visitor" they've never met.

### 📚 Vocabulary Focus (Synthesis & Expansion)

| Informal (tú / vos) | Formal (usted) | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| ¿Cómo te llamas? | ¿Cómo se llama usted? | What's your name? |
| ¿Cómo estás? | ¿Cómo está usted? | How are you? |
| ¿Y tú? / ¿Y vos? | ¿Y usted? | And you? |
| Hola | Buenos días/tardes/noches | Hello / formal greeting |
| ¡Chao! / ¡Hasta luego! | Hasta luego / Que le vaya bien | Goodbye |

**New Today:**
| Spanish | English |
|---|---|
| Que le vaya bien | May things go well for you (formal farewell) |
| ¡Chao! | Bye! (widely used informally; from Italian *ciao*) |
| Encantado/a | Delighted/Pleased to meet you |

### 🌍 Cultural Spotlight: Register in Real Life

**Colombia 🇨🇴** — *Usted* is used far more broadly in Colombia than in most other countries — even between close friends and family members in some regions (like Antioquia/Medellín). A Colombian child may say *usted* to their parent; this signals *respect*, not distance.

**Argentina & Uruguay 🇦🇷🇺🇾** — *Vos* is the standard informal pronoun. It is neither rude nor uneducated — it is the regional norm taught in schools. Argentines are sometimes surprised when Latin American learners don't recognize *vos* as legitimate.

**Spain 🇪🇸** — In Spain, *vosotros* is used for the plural informal "you all" (a form not used in Latin America, where *ustedes* covers both formal and informal plural). This is worth a brief mention to avoid confusion if students encounter Spanish content from Spain.

**Mexico 🇲🇽** — Among peers, dropping to first-name basis and using *tú* happens very quickly. The farewell *¡Chao!* (or spelled *chau* in the Southern Cone) is widely used informally across the Spanish-speaking world, borrowed from Italian.

### 🕐 Lesson Timeline (50 Minutes)

**Warm-Up / Activador: Formal or Informal? (8 min)**
Teacher reads 6 short phrases aloud. Students hold up a "T" card (tú/informal) or a "U" card (usted/formal) to indicate the register. Debrief quickly — emphasize the Colombia example where *usted* can be affectionate.

**Input: CI Script — Two Scenarios (15 min)**

> *[Set up two chairs at the front. One sign reads "PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE." The other reads "LUNCH TABLE."]*
>
> "Clase, I have two situations today. Two situaciones. Watch carefully."
>
> *[Scenario 1 — Walk stiffly to "Principal's Office" chair.]*
>
> "Buenos días. Me llamo Señorita Bluemel. ¿Cómo se llama usted? — Mucho gusto, Señor Director. El gusto es mío. ¿Cómo está usted hoy? — Bien, gracias."
>
> *[Freeze. Turn to class.]*
>
> "Did you hear it? FORMAL. Se llama. Usted. Director. Very respectful. Very professional."
>
> *[Now move to "LUNCH TABLE" — sit casually, wave.]*
>
> "¡Hola! ¿Qué onda? Me llamo Sofía — ¿y tú, cómo te llamas? — Mucho gusto, Andrés. ¿Cómo estás? — Más o menos. ¿Y tú? — ¡Bien, bien!"
>
> *[Freeze. Turn to class.]*
>
> "¿Formal o informal? — INFORMAL. Hola. Tú. ¿Qué onda? Sofía. Friends. Relaxed."
>
> *[Now add the vos layer.]*
>
> "In Argentina, that lunch table conversation? It sounds like THIS: ¿Y VOS, cómo te llamás? Vos. Same feeling. Same friendship. Different pronoun. Argentina. Uruguay. Totally normal."
>
> *[Write on board: tú → ¿cómo estás? | vos → ¿cómo estás? | usted → ¿cómo está?]*
>
> "Look — the verb changes! Estás for tú. Estás for vos — same form here! Está for usted. We'll study this more in Unit 2 — for now, just notice the pattern."

**Guided Practice: Role-Card Dialogues (15 min)**
Students receive scenario cards. Each card describes a context (e.g., "You are meeting your friend's grandmother." / "You are meeting a new student your age from Mexico City."). Partners decide: formal or informal? Then they perform a 4-6 line dialogue using all Week 1 vocabulary. Teacher circulates and coaches.

**Gallery Walk: Dialogue Posters (7 min)**
Pairs write their dialogue on a mini-whiteboard or large sticky note and post it. Class does a quick gallery walk, marking F (formal) or I (informal) on each posted dialogue with a small dot sticker.

**Debrief & IPA Preview (3 min)**
Teacher previews Day 5: "Tomorrow, you will meet a 'visitor' from a Spanish-speaking country. You won't know if it should be formal or informal at first — you'll have to figure it out from context clues. Just like a real conversation."

**Exit Ticket (2 min)**
Write a 3-line formal greeting + name exchange. Then write a 3-line informal version of the same interaction.

### 📝 Assessment & Scaffolding Notes

- **Scaffolding:** Keep the "T / U" cards available throughout the period for students who need a visual prompt for register decisions.
- **Extension:** Students write a short reflection: "Is there a formal/informal distinction in English? Where do you see it?" Connect to *sir/ma'am*, titles, etc.
- **IPA Connection:** This lesson is the direct bridge to the Day 5 performance task. The role-card dialogues are a rehearsal of the IPA format.
