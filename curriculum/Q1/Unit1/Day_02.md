### 📋 Activity Procedures & Teacher Guidance (Core Delivery)



| Time | Activity Title | Procedure & Instructional Details | Teacher Tips & Guidance | Examples |
|:---:|---|---|---|---|
| **7 min** | **Activador: El Termómetro Emocional** | Teacher mimes an emotion; students must shout the Spanish word. Then, students mime and the teacher guesses. | Over-exaggerate facial expressions. This creates a strong "Form-Meaning" connection without translation. | **T:** (Smiles big) <br>**C:** "¡Feliz!" <br>**T:** (Slumps shoulders) <br>**C:** "¡Triste!" |
| **13 min** | **Input: Estar + Emotion (Interpretive)** | Introduce the structure *"Yo estoy..."* Use images of famous characters or celebrities to describe their current state. | Focus on the sound of **"estoy"**. Use a gesture (pointing to self) to reinforce that it refers to the speaker's current state. | *"El Gato con Botas está triste. Yo estoy bien."* |
| **15 min** | **Task: La Pelota de Emociones (Interpersonal)** | Toss a soft ball. Whoever catches it must state their name, their feeling, and toss it to someone else with a question. | **Live-Grade:** Watch for the transition from *Me llamo* to *Estoy*. Many students confuse these early on. | **S1:** "Me llamo Ana. Estoy cansada. ¿Cómo estás tú, Juan?" |
| **10 min** | **Presentational: El Ticket de Salida Visual** | Students draw an emoji on a sticky note and write: *"Hola, me llamo [Name] y hoy estoy [Emotion]."* | Collect these as they leave. Use them to group students tomorrow or to check in with those who marked "Mal." | *"Hola, me llamo Leo y hoy estoy enojado."* |
| **5 min** | **Reflexión: Tone & Culture** | Discuss the difference between a "polite" *Bien* and a "real" answer. In some cultures, saying *así así* is an invitation to talk more. | Validating negative emotions in the TL (Target Language) builds trust. It shows Spanish is for "real life." | "Is it okay to say 'Mal' in Spanish class? Yes, because we are a community." |

### 📊 ACTFL-Aligned Performance Rubric (4-Tier Formative)

| Criteria | **Exceeds (4)** | **Meets (3)** | **Approaching (2)** | **Below (1)** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Comprehensibility** | Pronunciation is clear; differentiates between *estoy* and *está*. | Understood by someone accustomed to language learners. | Meaning is clear but vowels are heavily English-coded. | Incomprehensible; uses English emotion words. |
| **Language Control** | Correctly uses *Estoy + [Adjective]* with no syntax errors. | Uses *Estoy* correctly but may struggle with adjective endings. | Confuses *Me llamo* with *Estoy* (e.g., "Me llamo feliz"). | Cannot form a simple "I am" sentence. |
| **Interpersonal Quality** | Uses appropriate intonation for questions vs. statements. | Responds to prompts politely and accurately. | Relies on single words; avoids full sentences. | Refuses to speak or uses only English. |
| **Vocabulary Range** | Uses 6+ different emotion words accurately. | Uses 4-5 basic emotion words (bien, mal, triste, feliz). | Relies only on *Bien* or *Mal*. | Cannot identify emotions in context. |

### 📘 Pedagogical Blueprint: How to Implement this Lesson
> *A guide for establishing emotional literacy in the TL.*

**1. Managing the "Me llamo" vs "Estoy" confusion:**
This is the first major hurdle. Use physical anchors. Point to your name tag for *Me llamo*. Point to your chest/heart for *Estoy*. If a student says "Me llamo bien," gently tap your heart and model "Estoy bien."

**2. The Power of Emojis:**
In Week 1, emojis are your best friend. They provide "Universal Input." Use them on every slide to reduce the need for English translations.

**3. Live-Grading During the Ball Toss:**
Carry a roster. Mark a (+) for students using full sentences and a (/) for those using single words. This is your first data point on "Sentence-Level Production."

### 🚀 Differentiation & Enrichment

* **Support (Struggling):** Provide a "Sentence Starter" on the board: *Yo estoy _________.* Keep the visual mood meter visible at all times.
* **Enrichment (Achieving):** Challenge students to add *porque* (because) to their answer (e.g., *"Estoy cansado porque es lunes"*).
