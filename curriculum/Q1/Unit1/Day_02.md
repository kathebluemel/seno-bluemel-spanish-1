### 📌 Standards Leadership & Alignment

**National Standards Alignment (Primary)**
*Grounded in the pedagogical frameworks of **ACTFL, NCSSFL, AATSP, and JNCL-NCLIS**.*
- **Communication – Interpersonal:** Exchange information about personal well-being and feelings using high-frequency structures.
- **Communication – Interpretive:** Identify emotions and states of being through visual cues and authentic audio input.
- **Cultures – Practices:** Recognize the importance of the "extended greeting" (asking about well-being) in Hispanic social interactions.
- **Comparisons – Language:** Identify **cognates** (words that look/sound similar in English and Spanish) to build decoding confidence.

**NCSSFL-ACTFL Can-Do Statements**
> *I can ask someone how they are feeling using ¿Cómo estás?*
> *I can respond to questions about my well-being using at least three different emotion words.*
> *I can use cognates like 'nervioso' or 'excelente' to understand Spanish without a dictionary.*

**Missouri CLEs (Secondary Alignment)**
- I.1.2.A — Respond to simple questions about personal well-being.
- FL.4.A.1 — Identify cognates between Spanish and English.

### 🎯 Lesson Objectives (UbD Backward Design)

**Enduring Understanding:** Communication is about checking in on the human being in front of you. In the Spanish-speaking world, asking "¿Cómo estás?" is a vital cultural bridge that values the person over the schedule.

**Essential Question:** How can I use "language clues" (cognates) to understand a new language faster?

| Structure | Cognate Status | English |
|---|---|---|
| **¿Cómo estás?** | Non-Cognate | How are you? |
| **Estoy...** | Non-Cognate | I am... (feeling) |
| **Excelente** | **Cognate** | Excellent |
| **Nervioso/a** | **Cognate** | Nervous |
| **Emocionado/a** | **Cognate** | Excited |
| **Bien / Mal** | Non-Cognate | Good / Bad |
| **Así, así / Más o menos** | Non-Cognate | So-so |

### 🌍 Cultural Spotlight: The "Extended Greeting"

In the **21 Spanish-speaking countries**, a greeting is rarely just "Hola." 
* **The Ritual:** It is common to follow "Hola" with "¿Cómo estás?" and often questions about one's family. This reflects a cultural value of **Personalismo**—prioritizing personal connection.
* **Global Melody:** Whether you are in **Madrid, Spain** or **Asunción, Paraguay**, the words remain similar, but the "melody" of the voice changes. We celebrate these different "musics" of the Spanish language.

### 🕐 Lesson Timeline (50 Minutes)

**Warm-Up: The Greeting Review (5 min)**
Students use their **Desk Passports** from Day 1. They stand and greet three different peers using a time-based greeting (*Buenos días/Buenas tardes*) and their name (*Me llamo...*).

**Input: The "Emotion Ocean" CI Script (15 min)**
Teacher uses exaggerated facial expressions and gestures to model feelings.
- "Today, I am **excelente**! [Big smile/Thumbs up]."
- "Maybe a student is **nervioso**. [Shake hands/Bite lip]. It's Day 2! It is normal."
- Teacher asks students: "¿Cómo estás?" and guides them to use the **Cognate Wall** for easy wins.



**Activity: Cognate Detective (15 min)**
Students receive a list of 10 Spanish emotion words. They must "detect" which ones are cognates and guess their English meaning (e.g., *contenta, furioso, pánico, calma*). This builds **Linguistic Agency**.

**Interactive Practice: The "Feelings Ball" (10 min)**
Toss a soft ball. Whoever catches it answers "¿Cómo estás?" and then tosses it to a peer, asking the same question. 

**Exit Ticket: Emotion Emoji (5 min)**
Students draw an "Emoji" on a sticky note and write the Spanish word for how they feel *right now* as they leave.

### 📺 Supplemental Resource Bank

> 🎬 **Watch:** Educators and students may visit the [Seño Bluemel Que Chévere YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvfq1AXJiDzXMV4VlA9ve_w?view_as=subscriber) for supplemental videos on "Feelings and Cognates" to reinforce pronunciation.

### 📝 Scaffolding & Differentiation
- **Scaffolding:** Keep the "Cognate Wall" visible during all speaking activities.
- **Extension:** Challenge advanced students to use the word **"Porque"** (because) to explain their feeling (e.g., "Estoy excelente *porque* es la clase de español").
- **Visual Learners:** Use color-coding (Green for good feelings, Red for bad, Yellow for 'más o menos').
