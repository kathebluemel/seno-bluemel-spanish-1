- **Communication – Interpersonal:** Engage in conversations using greetings appropriate to time of day.
- **Cultures – Practices & Perspectives:** Examine how greeting practices vary across Spanish-speaking regions.
- **Comparisons – Language:** Compare how time-based greetings function in Spanish vs. English.

**NCSSFL-ACTFL Can-Do Statements**
> *I can greet someone appropriately for the time of day (morning, afternoon, evening).*
> *I can recognize that Spanish speakers in different countries may greet each other differently depending on context.*

**Missouri CLEs (Secondary)**
- FL.1.A.1 – Engage in simple conversations on familiar topics.

### 🎯 Lesson Objectives (UbD Backward Design)

**Enduring Understanding:** Greetings are culturally embedded — the time of day and relationship between speakers shape which greeting is appropriate.

**Essential Question:** Why don't Spanish speakers always use the same greeting, even when they mean the same thing?

**Transfer Goal (toward Day 5 IPA):** Students will select the correct time-based greeting in a simulated interaction with a "visitor" from a Spanish-speaking country.

### 🌍 Cultural Spotlight: Greetings Across the Spanish-Speaking World

**Colombia 🇨🇴** — *Buenos días, ¿cómo amaneció?* ("Good morning, how did you wake up?") is a warm, common greeting among adults, especially in Bogotá and Medellín. The question literally asks how you "dawned," reflecting a culture that values genuine check-ins.

**Argentina & Uruguay 🇦🇷🇺🇾** — The informal shortcut *Buenas* (without specifying morning/afternoon/night) is extremely common. Argentines also use *vos* instead of *tú*: *¿Y vos, cómo estás?* This is a fully standard, respected pronoun — not slang.

**Mexico 🇲🇽** — Informal greetings like *¿Qué onda?* ("What's up?") are widely used among friends and youth. It is the Mexican equivalent of "What's up?" and would not be appropriate in a formal school or business context.

**Teacher Note:** Use a world map or digital slide to point to each country as you introduce these. This builds cultural geography simultaneously.

### 🕐 Lesson Timeline (50 Minutes)

**Warm-Up / Activador (8 min)**
Review Day 1 vocabulary with a quick "Stand Up – Sit Down" TPR game: Teacher calls a greeting; students stand if it's formal, sit if it's informal.

**Input: Teacher-Led CI Script (15 min)**

> *[Enter the room, look at the clock, and wave at students with a big smile.]*
>
> "Buenos días, clase. ¡Buenos DÍAS! Miren el reloj — look at the clock — it's morning. Morning. Mañana. Buenos DÍAS."
>
> *[Point to clock, mime sun rising.]*
>
> "But wait — class, what if it's 2 PM? Two in the afternoon? Tarde. Tarde means afternoon. Then I say… ¿cómo se dice? BUENAS TARDES. Repeat — Buenas tardes."
>
> *[Class repeats. Point to a student named (or pretend-named) 'Marco.']*
>
> "Marco! It's 2 PM. I see Marco in the hallway. I say — Buenas tardes, Marco! And Marco says — Bien, gracias. ¿Y usted? That means 'Fine, thank you. And you?' This is FORMAL because Marco respects his teacher."
>
> *[Now shift, point to two 'friends' near each other.]*
>
> "But if Marco sees his FRIEND — his amigo — what does he say in Mexico? ¿Qué onda? That's Mexican Spanish. It means 'What's up?' Very informal. Very cool. Can we all say it? ¿QUÉ ONDA?"
>
> *[Students repeat with enthusiasm.]*
>
> "And in Argentina — Argentina is HERE on the map — they say: ¿Y vos, cómo estás? Vos. V-O-S. Not tú. Vos. Same meaning, different word. Spanish is HUGE. Spanish is GLOBAL."

**Guided Practice: Clock Activity (10 min)**
Display 6 different clock images (8 AM, 12 PM, 3 PM, 6 PM, 9 PM, 11 PM) on the board. For each clock, students write or call out the correct greeting. Discuss edge cases (Is noon *días* or *tardes*? Answer: *tardes* begins around noon/1 PM — vary by region).

**Pair Practice: Greeting Rotations (10 min)**
Students stand and rotate to greet 3 different partners. Each pair must:
1. Use a time-appropriate greeting (teacher displays current time)
2. Respond with *Bien, gracias* or *Más o menos*
3. Ask *¿Y tú?* (or challenge: try *¿Y vos?*)

**Cultural Reflection (5 min)**
Class discussion: "In English, do we change our greeting based on time of day? Why do you think Spanish does this?" Brief think-pair-share.

**Exit Ticket (2 min)**
Students write the correct greeting for three time prompts given by the teacher (e.g., "It's 7 AM — what do you say?").

### 📝 Assessment & Scaffolding Notes

- **Scaffolding:** Provide a visual "greeting clock" anchor chart for students who need it.
- **Extension:** Challenge early finishers to find one more regional greeting variant using approved classroom resources.
- **IPA Connection:** Students are building the bank of greetings they will select from in the Day 5 simulated global interaction.
