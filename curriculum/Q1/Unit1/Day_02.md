### 🎯 Learning Targets & Can-Do Statements
> **Essential Question:** Why don't Spanish speakers always use the same greeting, even when they mean the same thing?

* **Enduring Understanding:** Greetings are culturally embedded; the time of day and the relationship between speakers dictate the appropriate social "key."
* **Can-Do (Interpretive):** I can recognize which greeting is appropriate for morning, afternoon, and evening.
* **Can-Do (Interpersonal):** I can ask how someone is doing and respond using *bien, mal,* or *más o menos*.
* **Can-Do (Cultural):** I can identify *vos* as a standard pronoun used in regions like Argentina and Uruguay.

| **Buenas noches** | Good evening/night | **Muy bien** | Very well |
| **Buenas** | Hey/Hi (Shortcut) | **Más o menos** | So-so |
| **¿Qué onda?** | What's up? (Mexico) | **Mal** | Bad / Not well |

### 🌍 Cultural Spotlight: Greetings Across the Spanish-Speaking World



* **Colombia 🇨🇴:** In regions like Bogotá and Medellín, adults often ask: *"¿Cómo amaneció?"* (How did you "dawn"?). It reflects a deep cultural value in genuine personal check-ins.
* **Argentina & Uruguay 🇦🇷🇺🇾:** The shortcut **"Buenas"** is a universal social "save" used at any time. Importantly, they use **"vos"** instead of "tú." This is not slang; it is a standard, respected grammatical form.
* **Mexico 🇲🇽:** For informal peer-to-peer connection, **"¿Qué onda?"** is the gold standard. While cool among friends, it is rarely used in formal settings like a job interview or with an elder.
* **Missouri Connection 🇺🇸:** In the Midwest, we often stick to a casual "Hi" or "Hey" regardless of the hour. In Spanish, acknowledging the *time of day* is often seen as a sign of manners and education (*educación*).

### 📋 Activity Procedures & Teacher Guidance (Core Delivery)

| Time | Activity Title | Procedure & Instructional Details | Teacher Tips & Guidance | Examples |
|:---:|---|---|---|---|
| **8 min** | **Activador: Stand Up/Sit Down** | Call out greetings. Students stand if it’s formal (Usted) and sit if it’s informal (Tú). | Use physical speed to build engagement and "ear" training. | **T:** "¿Qué onda?" (Sit!) <br> **T:** "¿Cómo está usted?" (Stand!) |
| **15 min** | **Input: Teacher CI Script** | Deliver the **Time & Respect** script (found below). Use a clock prop or drawing. | Use the "Clock Strategy" to show the transition from *días* to *tardes*. | *"Son las dos de la tarde. ¡Buenas tardes!"* |
| **10 min** | **Practice: The Greeting Clock** | Display images of clocks (8 AM, 3 PM, 11 PM). Students call out the greeting. | Discuss the "Noon" edge case. *Tardes* usually starts after lunch (1 PM). | **Clock:** 9:00 PM <br> **S:** "Buenas noches." |
| **10 min** | **Interpersonal: Rotations** | Students find 3 partners. Must use a time-appropriate greeting and ask how they are. | Challenge high-flyers to use the Argentine *¿Y vos?* | *"¡Buenas! ¿Cómo estás?"* <br> *"Bien, gracias. ¿Y tú?"* |
| **5 min** | **Reflexión & Exit Ticket** | Students write the correct greeting for 7 AM, 2 PM, and 10 PM. | This is a quick data check for tomorrow’s warm-up. | **Ticket:** 1. Buenos días... |

### 📘 Pedagogical Blueprint: How to Implement this Lesson

**1. The "Respect" Metaphor:**
Explain to students that time-based greetings are like a "social handshake." Using *Buenos días* at 8 AM shows you are aware of your surroundings and the person you are speaking to.

**2. Scaffolding the Formal vs. Informal:**
Novice learners struggle with the *Tú* vs. *Usted* distinction. Use the **"Boss vs. Bestie" rule**: If you’d say it to your boss, use *Usted*. If you’d say it to your bestie, use *Tú*. 

**3. Script for the Teacher (CI Model):**
> *[Look at the clock, mime waking up/stretching]*
> "¡Buenos días, clase! Miren el reloj. Morning... Mañana. Buenos DÍAS. [Point to a student] Marco, it is 2:00 PM. Afternoon... Tarde. I don't say 'Buenos días.' I say: **Buenas tardes**. Repeat: Buenas tardes.
> 
> Now, look at Argentina. [Point to map]. They don't say '¿Cómo estás tú?' No. They say: **¿Cómo estás vos?** V-O-S. Same meaning, different country. And in México? To a friend? **¿Qué onda?** It's cool, it's Mexican. ¿QUÉ ONDA?"

### 🚀 Differentiation & Enrichment

* **Support (Struggling):** Provide a "Greeting Clock" anchor chart on their desks with visual sun/moon icons.
* **Enrichment (Achieving):** Challenge students to act out a scene where they must switch from *¿Qué onda?* (friend) to *¿Cómo está usted?* (principal) instantly.
* **Heritage Speakers:** Ask them to share if their family uses specific shortcuts like *"¡Buenas!"* or regional variants like *"¿Qué tal?"*
* **ELL Support:** Use visual cognates for "Morning" (Mañana/Morn) and "Afternoon" (Tarde/Tardy/Late) to help bridge vocabulary via Latin roots.
