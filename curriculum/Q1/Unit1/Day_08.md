### 🎯 Learning Targets & Can-Do Statements

* **Learning Target:** I can communicate my age and birthday using the verb *Tener* and numbers 0–31.
* **Can-Do (Interpretive):** I can identify specific dates and ages when hearing them in a series.
* **Can-Do (Interpersonal):** I can ask peers for their birthday and age to build a classroom database.
* **Can-Do (Presentational):** I can write a 3-sentence identity tag including my name, age, and birthday.

### 📋 Activity Procedures & Teacher Guidance (Core Delivery)



| Time | Activity Title | Procedure & Instructional Details | Teacher Tips & Guidance | Examples |
|:---:|---|---|---|---|
| **10 min** | **Activador: The Number Pulse** | Rhythmic counting 0-31. Clap on multiples of 5. Focus on the "Teens" (11-15). | High energy builds "Phonetic Muscle Memory." Don't let them skip the 'i' in *dieciséis*. | **T:** "¡Once!" <br>**C:** "¡Doce!" |
| **15 min** | **Input: The "I Have Years" Logic** | Mime holding a bag of years. *"Yo no soy 15. Yo TENGO 15 años."* Map out the 12 months (Cognates). | **Grammar Alert:** Use your "Age" video below. Explicitly show that "Soy 14" is a logic error in Spanish. | *"¿Cuántos años tienes?"* <br>*"Tengo catorce años."* |
| **12 min** | **Task: The Birthday Line-Up** | Students must form a line around the room in chronological birthday order (Jan-Dec). | **No English allowed.** Listen for the order: *"el [número] de [mes]"*. | **A:** "¿Cuándo es tu cumple?" <br>**B:** "Es el doce de octubre." |
| **8 min** | **Interactive: Digital Date Swap** | Show dates in US format (10/12) and have students write/say them in Global format (12/10). | This is a "Cognitive Switch." It forces them to process the *Day* first. | **US:** 3/14 <br>**Global:** 14/3 (el 14 de marzo) |
| **5 min** | **Reflexión: Cultural Milestones** | Brief mention of the Quinceañera. Why is the 15th birthday so significant in many Spanish-speaking cultures? | Connects age to community and tradition. | "Age isn't just a number; it's a new role in the family." |

### 📘 Pedagogical Blueprint: How to Implement this Lesson

**1. The "Possession of Experience" (Tener vs. Ser):**
One of the most common errors for English speakers is using *Ser* for age. To fix this, use the **Physical Container Metaphor**. Tell students: *"In English, age is a state of being (I AM young). In Spanish, age is an accumulated collection of experiences (I HAVE 14 years in my pocket)."* * **Teacher Move:** Carry a physical bag or box labeled "Mis Años." When you say *"Tengo 30 años,"* pat the bag. It turns an abstract grammar rule into a concrete visual.

**2. Breaking the "English Word Order" Habit:**
Students will naturally say *"Mayo doce"* because of their L1 (first language) interference. 
* **The Formula Method:** Write the formula **[ EL + # + DE + MES ]** in large letters on the board. 
* **Correction Strategy:** If a student says "Octubre cinco," simply point to the word **DE** on the board. This forces them to self-correct and realize that the preposition is the "bridge" that holds the Spanish date together.

**3. The "Insiders" Exception (El Primero):**
Explicitly teach that Spanish speakers almost never say *"El uno de..."* for the first day of the month. 
* **Cultural Context:** Tell them that using *"El primero"* is like a secret password that makes them sound like native speakers rather than students reading from a textbook. This builds "Cultural Capital" and makes a dry grammar rule feel like an elite language tip.
