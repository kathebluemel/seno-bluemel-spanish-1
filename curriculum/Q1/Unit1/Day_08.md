### 📌 Standards Leadership & Alignment

**National Standards Alignment (Primary)**
*Grounded in the frameworks of **ACTFL, NCSSFL, AATSP, and JNCL-NCLIS**.*
- **Communication – Interpersonal:** Sustain a multi-turn conversation synthesizing origin, name, and emotional state.
- **Communication – Presentational:** Introduce a peer to the community using third-person descriptors (*Es de / Está*).
- **Cultures – Perspectives:** Analyze how language reflects cultural values regarding permanent identity versus temporary experiences.
- **Comparisons – Language:** Examine the conceptual difference between *Ser* (essence) and *Estar* (condition), a distinction absent in English.

**NCSSFL-ACTFL Can-Do Statements**
> *I can conduct a full introduction sequence: greeting, name exchange, origin, and well-being.*
> *I can introduce a classmate using the correct third-person forms: "Es de..." and "Está...".*
> *I can explain the conceptual difference between permanent identity and temporary states in Spanish.*

**Missouri CLEs (Secondary Alignment)**
- FL.1.A.3 — Present basic information about another person to an audience.
- FL.4.A.1 — Identify unique grammatical features of the target language.

### 🎯 Lesson Objectives (UbD Backward Design)

**Enduring Understanding:** Spanish is a precise language that distinguishes between who we *are* (our essence) and how we *feel* (our current state). Understanding this "Dual To-Be" system is essential for global communication.

**Essential Question:** How does choosing the right verb change the meaning of what I say about myself and others?

### 📚 Vocabulary Synthesis: The Synthesis of Being

Today we introduce no new vocabulary; instead, we focus on **Syntactic Precision**.



| Concept | Verb Type | Linguistic Formula | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Identity / Origin** | **SER** (Permanent) | *Soy de... / Es de...* | *Soy de Missouri.* |
| **State / Feeling** | **ESTAR** (Temporary) | *Estoy... / Está...* | *Estoy excelente.* |

### 🌍 Cultural Spotlight: The Precision of "Being"

* **The Cuban Rhythm:** In **Cuba**, casual speech often softens the *s* in *estás*, making it sound like *¿Cómo 'tá?*. This is a regional phonetic trait, but the underlying distinction between origin (*soy cubano*) and state (*estoy bien*) remains fundamental.
* **The Mexican Introduction:** In **Mexico**, moving from *Usted* to *Tú* signals a shift in *confianza* (trust). However, regardless of formality, using *Ser* for your hometown shows that your origin is an unchangeable part of your soul.
* **The Colombian Identity:** In **Colombia**, mentioning your specific city (*Soy de Medellín*) is common. Because you "are" from there (Ser), it implies your regional traditions are part of your permanent identity.

### 🕐 Lesson Timeline (50 Minutes)

**Warm-Up: The 3-Second Challenge (7 min)**
Rapid-fire oral review. Teacher prompts: "Say your name," "Ask where I'm from," "Say you are nervous." Students must respond instantly to build **spontaneous output**.

**Input: The "Solid vs. Dotted" Circle CI Script (12 min)**
- Teacher draws a **Solid Circle** for **SER**. "This is your origin. It is permanent. *Yo soy de Colombia.* It doesn't change tomorrow."
- Teacher draws a **Dotted Circle** for **ESTAR**. "This is your mood. It is temporary. *Estoy cansado.* Tomorrow? *Estoy fantástico.* It changes!"
- Model the shift from 1st person (*Soy/Estoy*) to 3rd person (*Es/Está*).

**Activity: The Essence vs. Condition Sort (8 min)**
Students categorize phrases into "Essence" (Permanent) or "Condition" (Temporary). 
*Examples: Me llamo Juan (Essence), Estoy mal (Condition), Soy de Perú (Essence).*

**Main Activity: The Global Interview & Intro (18 min)**
Students interview a partner to create an **Identity Profile**. 
- **Task:** Introduce your partner to a small group.
- **Formula:** *"Les presento a [Nombre]. Es de [País/Ciudad] y hoy está [Emoción]."*

**Exit Ticket: The Verb Check (5 min)**
Write one sentence using *Soy* and one using *Estoy*. Explain why you chose each verb based on the "Solid vs. Dotted" circle concept.

### 📝 Scaffolding & Differentiation
- **Scaffolding:** Keep the "Solid vs. Dotted" visual on the board throughout the interview process.
- **Extension:** Research a famous Hispanic figure and write a 4-sentence introduction using *Es de* and *Está* based on a current event (e.g., "Lionel Messi is from Argentina and is happy because he won").
- **IPA Connection:** This activity is the direct rehearsal for the Presentational Mode of the Day 10 IPA.
