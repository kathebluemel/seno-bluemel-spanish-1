### 📌 Standards & Objectives

**ACTFL World-Readiness Standards (Primary)**
- **Communication – Interpersonal:** Sustain a multi-turn conversation combining origin, name, and emotional state.
- **Communication – Presentational:** Introduce a partner to the class using information gathered in conversation.
- **Cultures – Practices & Perspectives:** Analyze how greetings, origin, and emotional expression work together as a complete social interaction across cultures.
- **Comparisons – Language:** Examine the difference between *ser* (permanent identity) and *estar* (temporary state) as a unique feature of Spanish not found in English.

**NCSSFL-ACTFL Can-Do Statements**
> *I can have a short conversation where I greet someone, share names, ask where they're from, and ask how they feel.*
> *I can introduce someone else using* se llama, es de, *and* está.
> *I can recognize that Spanish uses two different verbs where English uses only "to be."*

**Missouri CLEs (Secondary)**
- FL.1.A.1 — Engage in simple multi-turn conversations on familiar topics.
- FL.1.A.3 — Present basic information about another person to an audience.
- FL.4.A.1 — Identify grammatical features that differ between Spanish and English.

### 🎯 Lesson Objectives (UbD Backward Design)

**Enduring Understanding:** A real conversation is more than vocabulary — it's connection. Combining what you know about greetings, names, origin, and feelings creates the foundation of human communication in any language.

**Essential Question:** What does it take to make someone feel truly *seen* in a conversation?

**Transfer Goal (toward Day 10 IPA):** Students will conduct a complete introduction sequence and present a partner's information — directly mirroring the Day 10 IPA interpersonal and presentational tasks.

### 📚 Vocabulary Focus (Synthesis Day — No New Vocabulary)

Today's lesson intentionally introduces no new vocabulary. All energy goes toward *combining and extending* what students already know.

**Key Structures Reviewed:**

| Structure | Example |
|---|---|
| *¿Cómo te llamas?* / *Me llamo…* | Name exchange |
| *¿De dónde eres?* / *Soy de…* | Origin exchange |
| *¿Cómo estás?* / *Estoy…* | Feelings exchange |
| *¿Y tú? / ¿Y usted?* | Turn-taking |
| *Mucho gusto / Igualmente* | Courtesy closers |
| *Se llama… / Es de… / Está…* | Third-person introduction |

**Grammar Spotlight (Comprehensible Input — No Production Required):**

> In English, we use ONE verb: **"to be."**
> *I am Sofia. I am from Mexico. I am tired.*
>
> In Spanish, there are TWO verbs:
> - **Ser** → *identity, origin, permanent traits* → **Soy** Sofia. **Soy** de México.
> - **Estar** → *temporary states, feelings* → **Estoy** cansada.
>
> This is one of the most fascinating features of Spanish. Your origin (*soy de*) is part of who you ARE. Your tiredness (*estoy cansada*) is how you feel RIGHT NOW — it will change.

### 🌍 Cultural Spotlight: The Art of the Introduction

**Colombia 🇨🇴** — In Colombian professional culture, introductions often include your *ciudad* (city) as well as your country, because regional identity is so strong. *Me llamo Carlos. Soy de Medellín, Colombia.* The city often carries as much weight as the country.

**Cuba 🇨🇺** — Cuban Spanish is famously fast and musical, with syllables often dropped or softened. *¿Cómo estás?* can sound like *¿Cómo 'tá?* in casual speech. When a Cuban introduces a friend, warmth and humor are often woven in: *Les presento a mi amigo, el mejor de todos.* ("Let me introduce my friend, the best of all.")

**Mexico 🇲🇽** — Formal introductions in Mexican business culture involve a firm handshake and full name. Among youth, introductions happen quickly and often include a nickname (*apodo*) right away. The concept of *confianza* (trust/familiarity) drives how fast people move from formal to informal.

**Argentina 🇦🇷** — Argentines often preface introductions with context: *Te presento a Lucía — la conocí en el trabajo.* ("Let me introduce you to Lucía — I met her at work.") Context and connection are considered polite additions to a simple name.

### 🕐 Lesson Timeline (50 Minutes)

**Warm-Up / Activador: Vocabulary Speed Round (7 min)**
Teacher calls a prompt — students respond in 3 seconds or less:
- *"Say your name in Spanish."* → *Me llamo ___.*
- *"Ask where I'm from."* → *¿De dónde eres?*
- *"Say you're tired."* → *Estoy cansado/a.*
- *"Say goodbye formally."* → *Hasta luego / Que le vaya bien.*
- *"Say 'cool' like a Colombian."* → *¡Chévere!*

Fast, fun, competitive energy. No writing. All oral.

**Input: CI Script — The Ser vs. Estar Revelation (12 min)**

> *[Hold up two fingers.]*
>
> "Class — dos verbos. TWO verbs. English has ONE — 'to be.' I AM Sofia. I AM from Mexico. I AM tired. One verb. Easy, right? Spanish says — no. No, no, no. Spanish has TWO."
>
> *[Write on board: SER | ESTAR]*
>
> "SER — [draw a solid, permanent circle] — is for WHO YOU ARE. Your name. Your origin. Your identity. These things don't change every day."
>
> *[Write: Soy Seño Bluemel. Soy de Colombia.]*
>
> "I AM Seño Bluemel — forever. I AM from Colombia — forever. SOY. Ser."
>
> *[Draw a dotted, temporary circle beside it.]*
>
> "ESTAR — [tap the dotted circle] — is for HOW YOU ARE right now. This moment. This morning. Estoy cansada — today. Tomorrow? Maybe estoy muy bien. It changes. Temporary."
>
> *[Mime being tired, then suddenly energetic.]*
>
> "Estoy cansada HOY. Mañana — tomorrow — estoy bien. See? It changes. That's ESTAR."
>
> *[Now show the third-person forms.]*
>
> "Now — what if I'm talking ABOUT someone? Not me — them. [Point to a student.] She's not here talking — I'm introducing her. She IS — ella ES — Sofia. Es de Puerto Rico. Es de aquí. And she feels — ella ESTÁ — contenta hoy. ES. ESTÁ. Third person."
>
> *[Write on board: SOY / ES | ESTOY / ESTÁ]*
>
> "You don't need to memorize all the forms today. Just notice. Feel the difference. Ser = identity. Estar = feelings. Two beautiful verbs. Spanish is PRECISE."

**Guided Practice: Two-Column Sort (8 min)**
Students receive 12 sentence strips (*Soy de México. Estoy nervioso. Me llamo Andrés. Estoy muy bien. Es de Argentina. Está cansada.*) and sort them into SER or ESTAR columns on their desk. Partners check each other. Teacher debrief — any surprises?

**Main Activity: Interview & Introduction (18 min)**
Students interview a partner using all Week 2 vocabulary. They take notes on a structured graphic organizer:

```
Se llama: _______________
Es de: _______________
Hoy está: _______________
```

Then each student stands and introduces their partner to the class (or to another pair) using third-person structures: *Les presento a ___. Se llama ___. Es de ___. Hoy está ___.* Teacher models first.

**Exit Ticket (5 min)**
Write two sentences about yourself using *soy* and two using *estoy*. Label each: SER or ESTAR.

### 📝 Scaffolding & Differentiation Notes

- **Scaffolding:** Provide a SER vs. ESTAR anchor card with the permanent/temporary visual (solid circle vs. dotted circle) for reference throughout the activity.
- **Extension:** Students write a 6-sentence third-person paragraph introducing a famous Spanish-speaking person (athlete, musician, leader), using *es de*, *se llama*, and *está* correctly.
- **IPA Connection:** The interview + introduction activity is a direct rehearsal of the Day 10 IPA interpersonal and presentational modes.
