### 🎯 Learning Targets & Can-Do Statements
> *“Numbers are the data of identity. In Spanish, we don't 'are' an age; we 'have' years, and we 'are' the hour.”*

* **Learning Target:** I can communicate my age, my birthday, and tell the current time in Spanish.
* **Can-Do (Interpretive):** I can identify specific dates and times when hearing them in a series.
* **Can-Do (Interpersonal):** I can ask peers for the time (*¿Qué hora es?*) and their birthday (*¿Cuándo es tu cumple?*).
* **Can-Do (Presentational):** I can write a formal identity tag including my age, birthday, and the time of my favorite class.

### 📋 Activity Procedures & Teacher Guidance (Core Delivery)



| Time | Activity Title | Procedure & Instructional Details | Teacher Tips & Guidance | Examples |
|:---:|---|---|---|---|
| **5 min** | **Activador: The Number Pulse** | Rhythmic "call and response" counting 0-60. Focus on the transition from 20 to 30. | High energy is key. It builds "Phonetic Muscle Memory" for the tricky *veinte* and *treinta* sequences. | **T:** "¡Treinta!" <br>**C:** "¡Treinta y uno!" |
| **12 min** | **Input: "Tengo" vs "Son las"** | Model age: *"Tengo catorce años."* Transition to time: *"Son las nueve."* Use a physical clock to move hands. | **Grammar Alert:** Strictly enforce *Tener* for age and *Ser* for time. Point to yourself for age and your wrist/clock for time. | *"Yo tengo 30 años. Ahora, son las diez de la mañana."* |
| **15 min** | **Task: The Global Schedule** | Students move around to "book appointments" with peers at specific times and dates. | **Live-Grade:** Watch for the date format. Ensure they say *"el [número] de [mes]"* and use *"Es la una"* for 1:00. | **A:** "¿A qué hora?" <br>**B:** "A las dos y media." |
| **8 min** | **Interactive: Digital vs Analog** | Show digital times (14:30) and have students provide the analog Spanish equivalent (*Son las dos y media*). | Reinforce the use of the 24-hour clock common in Spanish-speaking countries. | **Digital:** 15:00 <br>**S:** "Son las tres." |
| **5 min** | **Reflexión: Global Formats** | Discuss the Day/Month/Year format and military time. Why does the world use these standards? | Reinforce that 05/02 is February 5th in the Spanish-speaking world, not May 2nd. | "International literacy prevents missing your flight!" |

| Criteria | **Exceeds (4)** | **Meets (3)** | **Approaching (2)** | **Below (1)** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Comprehensibility** | Flawless number pronunciation. Vowels in months/time are crisp. | Understood by someone used to learners. | Meaning is clear but relies on heavy English accent. | Incomprehensible; uses English numbers. |

### 📘 Pedagogical Blueprint: How to Implement this Lesson

**1. The "Tener" vs "Ser" Distinction:**
Students will try to use one verb for everything. Consistently use gestures: a "hugging" motion for *Tener* (possessing years) and a "pointing to the sky/clock" motion for *Ser* (the state of time).

**2. The "De" Bridge:**
In dates, the "de" is non-negotiable (*el siete de mayo*). In time, "de la" is the bridge to the period of day (*de la tarde*). 

**3. 1:00 is Special:**
Remind students that *Es la una* is the only time that uses the singular "Es" because 1 is a singular hour.
