### 📋 Activity Procedures & Teacher Guidance (Core Delivery)



| Time | Activity Title | Procedure & Instructional Details | Teacher Tips & Guidance | Examples |
|:---:|---|---|---|---|
| **10 min** | **Activador: El Horario Misterioso** | Teacher describes a schedule: *"Primero, tengo arte. Segundo, tengo ciencias..."* Students must draw the icons for each class in order. | Use **Ordinal Numbers** (Primero, Segundo, Tercero). This provides a natural way to review numbers while learning subjects. | **T:** "Tercero, tengo matemáticas." <br>**S:** (Draws a plus sign/calculator) |
| **12 min** | **Input: ¿Te gusta o no?** | Use a "Thumbs Up/Down" activity. Show icons for subjects. Ask: *"¿Te gusta el arte?"* Students respond physically and then with *"Me gusta"* or *"No me gusta"*. | **Grammar Alert:** Introduce *Me gusta* as a "feeling" (from Day 2). Ensure they don't say "Yo gusto." | *"A mí me gusta la historia. No me gusta el inglés."* |
| **15 min** | **Task: La Entrevista Escolar** | Students move around to find peers who share at least two classes with them. They must ask: 1. *¿Qué clase tienes?* 2. *¿Te gusta?* | **Live-Grade:** Listen for the pronunciation of "Ciencias" (soft C) and "Matemáticas" (stress on the 'a'). | **A:** "¿Qué clase tienes tercero?" <br>**B:** "Tengo banda. Me gusta mucho." |
| **8 min** | **Presentational: Mi Día Ideal** | Students write 3 sentences describing their favorite part of the day. | Encourage the use of adjectives from Day 6 (e.g., *"La clase de arte es divertida"*). | *"Primero, tengo arte. Me gusta mucho porque es divertido."* |
| **5 min** | **Reflexión: Global Schools** | Quick comparison: In many Spanish-speaking countries, students stay in one room and teachers move. How does that change "Identidad"? | Discussion on community: Staying with the same group of peers all day builds a different social bond. | "In Spain, your classmates are like your second family." |

### 📊 ACTFL-Aligned Performance Rubric (4-Tier Formative)

| Criteria | **Exceeds (4)** | **Meets (3)** | **Approaching (2)** | **Below (1)** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Comprehensibility** | Pronunciation is clear and fluid. Correct stress on multi-syllable subjects. | Understood by someone used to learners. | Meaning is clear but relies on English phonetics for "Ciencias" or "Geografía." | Incomprehensible; uses English subject names. |
| **Language Control** | Uses *Me gusta/No me gusta* and *Tengo* with 100% accuracy. | Consistently uses *Me gusta*. Minor errors in ordinal numbers. | Uses "Yo gusta" or "Soy [Class]" instead of "Tengo [Class]". | Cannot form a preference or state a class. |
| **Interpersonal Quality** | Interaction is fluid. Adds details like "Me gusta mucho" or "Es difícil." | Successfully completes the interview task in the target language. | Relies on single-word answers (e.g., just saying "Arte"). | Refuses to interact; speaks only English. |
| **Vocabulary Range** | Uses 8+ school subjects and ordinal numbers correctly. | Uses 5-6 common school subjects accurately. | Relies only on cognates like "Música" or "Arte." | Cannot name school subjects in Spanish. |

### 📘 Pedagogical Blueprint: How to Implement this Lesson
> *A guide for managing the transition from personal traits to daily routine.*

**1. The "Me gusta" Logic:**
Remind students that *Me gusta* literally means "It is pleasing to me." This is why we don't say "Yo gusto." If they struggle, have them imagine the class "giving" them a feeling.

**2. Ordinal Numbers (1st-5th):**
Focus heavily on the first five: *Primero, Segundo, Tercero, Cuarto, Quinto*. These are the most common in a school day. Connect *Cuarto* to "Quarter" and *Segundo* to "Second" to help them remember.

**3. Handling "Almuerzo" and "Recreo":**
Include these as "subjects." For many students, these are the most important parts of the identity map. It's also a great cultural hook to talk about *Siesta* or long lunch breaks in other countries.

### 🚀 Differentiation & Enrichment

* **Support (Struggling):** Provide a visual schedule template with icons and the Spanish words underneath for reference during the interview.
* **Enrichment (Achieving):** Challenge students to explain *why* they like a class using adjectives (e.g., *"Me gusta la ciencia porque es interesante"*).
