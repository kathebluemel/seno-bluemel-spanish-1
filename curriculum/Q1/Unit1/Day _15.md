- **Communication – Interpretive:** Analyze and decode biographical data using the Global Date Format (DD/MM/YYYY).
- **Communication – Presentational:** Draft a formal identity profile that synthesizes numerical, biographical, and cultural data.
- **Cultures – Practices:** Evaluate the intersection of personal birthdays and national holidays (Independence Days).

### 🎯 IPA Design Overview (UbD — Stage 1 Transfer)

**Enduring Understanding:** In a globalized world, numerical literacy is cultural literacy. Knowing how to read a date and respect a celebration tradition is the foundation of professional and personal connection.



**Performance Tasks:**
1. **Interpretive:** The "Global Passport" Analysis.
2. **Interpersonal:** The "Birthday Serenade" Interview.
3. **Presentational:** The "International Birthday Board" Profile.

### 📋 IPA Task 1: Interpretive Reading (12 minutes)

**The Context:** You are the coordinator for the school's "International Birthday Board." You have received four student profiles from around the world. To post them, you must first decode their numerical data correctly.



* **Camila (Peru) 🇵🇪:** Birthday: **28/07**. *Key: Independence Day celebrations.*
* **Diego (Bolivia) 🇧🇴:** Birthday: **06/08**. *Key: Traditional 'Mañanitas' serenade.*
* **Abena (Eq. Guinea) 🇬🇶:** Birthday: **12/10**. *Key: Independence Day & communal 'Ubuntu' celebration.*
* **Valentina (Bolivia) 🇧🇴:** Birthday: **21/03**. *Key: Andean New Year and Pachamama offerings.*

### 📋 IPA Task 2: Interpersonal Role-Play (15 minutes)

**Scenario:** You are meeting your assigned visitor for a data-verification interview.
* **The Goal:** Confirm their name, origin, age, and exact birthday.
* **The Challenge:** The visitor will provide their birthday in the *el [número] de [mes]* format. You must acknowledge the date and react with a culturally appropriate expression (e.g., *¡Qué padre!, ¡Wepa!, or ¡Feliz cumpleaños!*).
* **Success Criteria:** Maintain the correct register (*Tú* vs. *Usted*) and use *Tener* correctly for age.

### 📋 IPA Task 3: Presentational Writing (12 minutes)

**Task:** Create the final "Birthday Card" for the classroom display.
**Logic Check:** To avoid any confusion for English-speaking visitors, you must write the date in **three distinct ways**:
1.  **Numerical Global Format** (e.g., 28/07/2010)
2.  **Full Spanish Written Format** (e.g., el veintiocho de julio)
3.  **American Interpretation** (e.g., July 28th)

### 📝 Teacher Notes: Portfolio & Transition
* **Portfolio Artifact #3:** This Profile Card serves as the final evidence for Unit 1.
* **Data-Driven Instruction:** Use Task 2 to identify students still struggling with the *Ser vs. Estar vs. Tener* distinctions before starting Unit 2.
* **Next Unit Preview:** **Unit 2: La Vida Escolar**. We will transition from personal identity to school life, using our numbers for schedules and the alphabet for spelling.
