### 📋 Activity Procedures & Teacher Guidance (Core Delivery)



| Time | Activity Title | Procedure & Instructional Details | Teacher Tips & Guidance | Examples |
|:---:|---|---|---|---|
| **10 min** | **Activador: El BINGO Rápido** | Students draw a 3x3 grid and fill it with random numbers 0–20. Teacher calls out numbers in Spanish. | Use this to check "Input Recognition." If students are slow to mark their cards, you know they haven't memorized the sounds yet. | **T:** "¡Catorce!" <br>**S:** (Marks 14) |
| **10 min** | **Input: ¿Cuántos años tienes?** | Use the "Age of Celebrities" strategy. Show images of celebrities and ask: *"¿Cuántos años tiene?"* | **Grammar Alert:** Use gestures to show "Having" age. Act as if you are holding something in your hands to emphasize *Tener*. | *"Él tiene diez años. Yo tengo catorce años."* |
| **15 min** | **Task: La Entrevista de Cumpleaños** | Students move around the room. They must find 3 people with a different age than them and record: 1. Name 2. Age. | **Live-Grade:** Walk around and listen for the "gn" sound in *años*. Ensure they aren't saying "anos" (incorrect meaning). | **A:** "¿Cuántos años tienes?" <br>**B:** "Tengo quince años. ¿Y tú?" |
| **10 min** | **Presentational: The Digital Profile** | Students draft a "Social Media Bio" (3 sentences): 1. Greeting 2. Name 3. Age. | Check for the tilde over the 'ñ' in *años*. This is a non-negotiable for accuracy and cultural respect. | *"¡Hola! Me llamo Sofia y tengo trece años."* |
| **5 min** | **Reflexión: The Verb "Tener"** | Quick discussion: In English, we say "I *am* 15." In Spanish, we say "I *have* 15 years." Why the difference? | Frame it as: "In Spanish, age is something you have collected over time, like a treasure." | "I possess 15 years of experience in life!" |

### 📘 Pedagogical Blueprint: How to Implement this Lesson
> *A guide for managing the transition from vocabulary to syntax.*



**1. The "Anos" vs "Años" Warning:**
Explain clearly that the tilde (~) changes the sound and the meaning entirely. It’s a great way to show that small details in Spanish carry huge weight.

**2. Scaffolding Numbers 11–15:**
These are the most difficult numbers for beginners. Spend extra time on *Once, Doce, Trece, Catorce, Quince*. Use a rhythmic chant or a clap to help them memorize the "ce" ending.

**3. The Goal of the Interview:**
The interview isn't just about numbers; it's about "Interpersonal Stamina." Can they keep a conversation going for 30 seconds without switching to English? Reward the effort of staying in the Target Language.

### 🚀 Differentiation & Enrichment

* **Support (Struggling):** Provide a "Number Key" on the board that shows the numeral and the Spanish word side-by-side.
* **Enrichment (Achieving):** Challenge students to ask for a "fake" phone number (*¿Cuál es tu número de teléfono?*) to practice numbers 0–9 in a different sequence.
