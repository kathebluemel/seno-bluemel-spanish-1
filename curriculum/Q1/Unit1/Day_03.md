### 📋 Activity Procedures & Teacher Guidance (Core Delivery)

| Time | Activity Title | Procedure & Instructional Details | Teacher Tips & Guidance | Examples |
|:---:|---|---|---|---|
| **10 min** | **Activador: ¿Dónde está...?** | Teacher projects a world map. Students use a laser pointer or come to the board to find countries called out in Spanish. | Use this to establish a "Global Perspective." Ensure students realize Spanish isn't just spoken in Spain and Mexico. | **T:** "Busca Colombia." <br>**S:** (Points to Colombia) |
| **10 min** | **Input: El Verbo Ser (Origen)** | Model the question *"¿De dónde eres?"* and the response *"Yo soy de..."* Use flags of different countries to provide visual cues. | **Grammar Alert:** Differentiate between *Estar* (Day 2 emotions) and *Ser* (Day 4 origin). Use the acronym "DOCTOR" (Origin) vs "PLACE" (Emotions). | *"Yo soy de los Estados Unidos. Shakira es de Colombia."* |
| **15 min** | **Task: Pasaporte de Clase (Interpersonal)** | Students receive a "blank passport." They must "travel" around the room, asking peers where they are from (can be real or assigned "secret" origins). | **Live-Grade:** Listen for the preposition **"de"**. Students often omit it (e.g., "Yo soy Missouri"). Model the "link" between soy and origin. | **A:** "¿De dónde eres?" <br>**B:** "Soy de México. ¿Y tú?" |
| **10 min** | **Presentational: Mapa de Identidad** | Students color a map of a country they are interested in and write: *"Me llamo [Nombre], tengo [Edad] años y soy de [País]."* | This is a great artifact for a classroom wall display. It visually reinforces the diversity discussed in class. | *"Me llamo Alex y soy de España."* |
| **5 min** | **Reflexión: Who is a "Spanish-Speaker"?** | Discussion: If someone is from the US but speaks Spanish, are they "Hispanic"? Introduce the concept of heritage speakers. | This validates the heritage speakers in your room and establishes a inclusive community. | "You don't have to be from a Spanish-speaking country to speak Spanish." |

### 📊 ACTFL-Aligned Performance Rubric (4-Tier Formative)

| Criteria | **Exceeds (4)** | **Meets (3)** | **Approaching (2)** | **Below (1)** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Comprehensibility** | Clear pronunciation. Proper stress on *Soy* and country names. | Understood by someone accustomed to learners. | Heavy English accent makes country names hard to recognize. | Incomprehensible; uses English country names only. |
| **Language Control** | Consistently uses *Soy de* correctly with no omission of 'de'. | Uses *Soy de* correctly but might hesitate before the origin. | Uses "Soy [Origin]" without the preposition "de". | Confuses *Soy* with *Estoy* or *Me llamo*. |
| **Interpersonal Quality** | Interaction is fluid and polite. Uses *Mucho gusto*. | Successfully exchanges origin data with 3+ peers. | Relies on single-word answers (just the country name). | Refuses to interact or uses only English. |
| **Geographic Literacy** | Can identify 10+ countries on a map without labels. | Can identify 5-7 countries on a map. | Can only identify Mexico and Spain. | Cannot locate any Spanish-speaking countries on a map. |

### 📘 Pedagogical Blueprint: How to Implement this Lesson
> *A guide for managing the transition from "State of Being" to "Fixed Identity."*

**1. Ser vs. Estar (The First Great Divide):**
Don't get bogged down in deep grammar yet. Simply tell students: "How you feel is *Estar*; who you are/where you're from is *Ser*." Use different hand signals for each to provide a kinesthetic anchor.

**2. The "De" Factor:**
In English, we can say "I am American." In Spanish, the most common way for beginners is "I am *from* [Place]." Stress that "de" is the bridge to their home.

**3. Pronunciation of "Estados Unidos":**
This is often the hardest origin for US students to say. Practice the "s" sounds and the "u" (oo) sound. Have them chant it: *Es-ta-dos U-ni-dos*.

---

### 🚀 Differentiation & Enrichment

* **Support (Struggling):** Provide a list of country names in Spanish with their English equivalents and flag icons.
* **Enrichment (Achieving):** Challenge students to learn the capital of the country they chose for their "Identity Map."
