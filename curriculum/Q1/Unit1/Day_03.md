### 🎯 Lesson Objectives (UbD Backward Design)

**Enduring Understanding:** In all cultures, knowing someone's name is the foundation of relationship — but *how* you ask and respond reflects your level of formality and cultural awareness.

**Essential Question:** Is there only one right way to ask someone's name in Spanish?

**Transfer Goal (toward Day 5 IPA):** Students will introduce themselves and ask a "global visitor's" name as part of the simulated interaction assessment.

### 📚 Vocabulary Focus

| Spanish | English |
|---|---|
| ¿Cómo te llamas? | What's your name? (informal) |
| ¿Cómo se llama usted? | What's your name? (formal) |
| Me llamo… | My name is… |
| Se llama… | His/Her name is… |
| Mucho gusto | Nice to meet you |
| El gusto es mío | The pleasure is mine |
| Igualmente | Likewise |
| ¿Y tú? / ¿Y usted? | And you? (informal/formal) |

### 🌍 Cultural Spotlight: Names & Introductions Across the Spanish-Speaking World

**Spain 🇪🇸** — In Spain, the customary response to *Mucho gusto* is *El gusto es mío* ("The pleasure is mine") in formal settings, though *Igualmente* is perfectly standard in casual use. Spaniards tend to use first names quickly, even in professional settings, compared to more formal Latin American contexts.

**Mexico 🇲🇽** — Informal introductions among young people often skip *Mucho gusto* altogether. You might hear: *¿Cómo te llamas? — Me llamo Luis. — ¡Qué onda, Luis!* The transition to informality happens very fast.

**Argentina & Uruguay 🇦🇷🇺🇾** — Since *vos* is standard, students will encounter: *¿Y vos, cómo te llamás?* — note the accent shift on *llamás* (vos conjugation). This is grammatically correct and regionally respected. The teacher can model this as a "fun linguistic pattern" without requiring mastery.

**Cultural Note on Last Names:** In Spanish-speaking cultures, most people carry **two last names** — the father's first surname followed by the mother's first surname (e.g., García López). This is important context for the IPA, where students meet a "visitor" with a full Spanish name.

### 🕐 Lesson Timeline (50 Minutes)

**Warm-Up / Activador (5 min)**
Quick review: Teacher displays 3 clocks. Students call out the correct greeting. Builds Day 2 retention before moving to new content.

**Input: Teacher-Led CI Script (18 min)**

> *[Walk in as if meeting the class for the first time, acting surprised.]*
>
> "¡Oh! ¡Hola! Buenos días — or buenas tardes — I don't know you! ¿Cómo te llamas? ¿Cómo — how — te llamas — you call yourself? In Spanish, we say 'I call myself' — me LLAMO. ME LLAMO. It's like your name is what you CALL yourself."
>
> *[Point to self dramatically.]*
>
> "Me llamo Seño Bluemel. Me llamo — say it with me — ME LLAMO. Now you. Tell your neighbor: Me llamo ___. Go."
>
> *[Brief 30-second partner turn. Bring focus back.]*
>
> "¿Y cómo te llamas tú? — [point to a student] — And YOU, what do you call yourself? Sí, me llamo [student name]. ¡Mucho gusto! Mucho — much — gusto — pleasure. Much pleasure. Nice to meet you!"
>
> *[Student responds or teacher models: 'Igualmente.']*
>
> "Igualmente. I-gual-mente. E-qual-ly. Likewise. Same to you. ¡Muy bien!"
>
> *[Shift to formal register — pick up an imaginary phone or put on a pretend "adult voice."]*
>
> "Now I'm a PROFESSIONAL. A business person. Formal. I don't say ¿cómo TE llamas? I say — ¿Cómo SE llama usted? Usted — that's the formal 'you.' Very respectful."
>
> *[Model a stiff, formal handshake with a student volunteer.]*
>
> "¿Cómo se llama usted? — Señor Johnson! — Mucho gusto, Señor Johnson. El gusto es mío. El gusto — the pleasure — es mío — is mine. The pleasure is MINE."
>
> *[Now pull out a "passport" prop or flag image for Argentina.]*
>
> "And in Argentina — vos country — they ask: ¿Y vos, cómo te llamás? [Write on board: llamás] See the accent? That accent tells you: this is VOS. Argentine Spanish. Still beautiful Spanish. Still correct."

**Guided Practice: Name Interview Chain (12 min)**
Students sit in a circle or rows. Each student introduces themselves and asks the next person their name using the full exchange:
- *¿Cómo te llamas?* → *Me llamo ___. Mucho gusto.* → *Igualmente.*

Teacher circulates and coaches pronunciation and formality choices.

**Partner Writing Practice (8 min)**
Students write a 4-line dialogue introducing two characters (they can be fictional or use their own names). Must include: greeting, name exchange, *mucho gusto* response. Share with a partner to check.

**Cultural Reflection (5 min)**
Brief class discussion: "Why do you think Spanish-speaking cultures use two last names? What would YOUR name be using that system?"

**Exit Ticket (2 min)**
On a notecard: Write how you would introduce yourself formally to a school principal in Spanish. Then write how you'd introduce yourself to a new friend.

### 📝 Assessment & Scaffolding Notes

- **Scaffolding:** Provide a sentence frame card: *¿Cómo te llamas? → Me llamo ___. Mucho gusto. → Igualmente.*
- **Extension:** Students research the full name of a famous Spanish-speaking athlete or artist and explain how their two surnames work.
- **IPA Connection:** The name exchange is a required component of the Day 5 IPA interaction.
