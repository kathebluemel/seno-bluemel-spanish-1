### 📌 Standards Leadership & Alignment

**National Standards Alignment (Primary)**
*Grounded in the pedagogical frameworks of **ACTFL, NCSSFL, AATSP, and JNCL-NCLIS**.*
- **Communication – Interpersonal:** Exchange personal information including names and courtesies in simple conversations.
- **Communication – Presentational:** State one's own name and ask for another's name in both formal and informal contexts.
- **Cultures – Perspectives:** Understand naming conventions (double surnames) and how introductions function as a sign of respect across cultures.
- **Comparisons – Language:** Identify the distinction between the informal (*tú*) and formal (*usted*) registers in introductions.

**NCSSFL-ACTFL Can-Do Statements**
> *I can tell someone my name and ask for theirs using the appropriate level of formality.*
> *I can respond to an introduction with a culturally appropriate courtesy like "Mucho gusto" or "Igualmente."*
> *I can explain why many people in Spanish-speaking cultures have two surnames.*

**Missouri CLEs (Secondary Alignment)**
- FL.1.A.1 – Engage in simple conversations on familiar topics.
- FL.3.A.1 – Connect Spanish naming practices to social studies and history.

### 🎯 Lesson Objectives (UbD Backward Design)

**Enduring Understanding:** Personal identity is the foundation of relationship. How we introduce ourselves—and how we honor others' names—reflects our level of global cultural awareness.

**Essential Question:** How does the way I introduce myself change depending on whom I am speaking to?

### 📚 Vocabulary Focus: Establishing Identity

| Spanish | Register / Context | English |
|---|---|---|
| **¿Cómo te llamas?** | Informal (*tú*) | What is your name? |
| **¿Cómo se llama usted?** | Formal (*usted*) | What is your name? |
| **Me llamo…** | Universal | My name is… (I call myself) |
| **Mucho gusto** | Universal | Nice to meet you |
| **El gusto es mío** | Formal / Traditional | The pleasure is mine |
| **Igualmente** | Universal | Likewise / Equally |

### 🌍 Cultural Spotlight: The Power of the Surname

Introduction rituals across the **21 Spanish-speaking countries** often involve more than just a first name.

* **The Double Surname:** In most Hispanic cultures, individuals carry **two last names** (e.g., *García López*). The first is the paternal surname (from the father), and the second is the maternal surname (from the mother). This maintains a visible connection to both sides of the family tree.
* **The "Vos" Variation:** In **Argentina, Uruguay,** and parts of Central America, you will hear *¿Cómo te llamás?* (with an accent on the 'a'). This is a regional variation that is a proud marker of identity.
* **Spain vs. The Americas:** While *Mucho gusto* is universal, in **Spain**, you may hear *Encantado/a* (Enchanted/Delighted) more frequently during a first meeting.

### 🕐 Lesson Timeline (50 Minutes)

**Warm-Up: The Time-Based Greeting (5 min)**
Teacher displays images of a sunrise, a midday sun, and a moon. Students must greet a partner with the correct time-based greeting (*Buenos días, etc.*).

**Input: The "Who is Who?" CI Script (18 min)**
Teacher models the difference between meeting a friend (Informal) and a principal/elder (Formal).
- **Informal:** "¡Hola! ¿Cómo te llamas? — Me llamo Luis. — ¡Mucho gusto!"
- **Formal:** "Buenos días, Señor Director. ¿Cómo se llama usted? — Me llamo Sr. Rodríguez. — El gusto es mío."
- Teacher explains that *Me llamo* literally means "I call myself."

**Activity: The Name Interview Chain (12 min)**
Students stand in two lines facing each other. They practice the full exchange: Greeting → Name Ask → Name Answer → Courtesy. On the teacher's signal, one line rotates so everyone meets a new "global citizen."

**Activity: "Mi Nombre Global" (8 min)**
Students calculate what their "Spanish Double Surname" would be based on their parents' names. They write it on the back of their **Desk Passport**.

**Exit Ticket: Formal vs. Informal (7 min)**
On a slip of paper, students write the correct "Name Question" for:
1. A new student in the cafeteria.
2. The President of a Spanish-speaking country.

### 📝 Scaffolding & Differentiation
- **Scaffolding:** Provide a "Handshake Guide" visual showing the formal vs. informal dialogue side-by-side.
- **Extension:** Challenge heritage speakers to share if their family uses specific titles of respect like *Don* or *Doña* before a name.
- **Kinesthetic:** Use a "talking piece" (like a small flag) to indicate whose turn it is to introduce themselves.
