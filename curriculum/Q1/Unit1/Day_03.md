### 🎯 Learning Targets & Can-Do Statements
> **Essential Question:** Is there only one right way to ask someone's name in Spanish?

* **Enduring Understanding:** In all cultures, knowing a name is the foundation of relationship—but *how* you ask and respond reflects your level of respect and regional awareness.
* **Can-Do (Interpersonal):** I can tell someone my name and ask for theirs using both formal and informal registers.
* **Can-Do (Interpretive):** I can understand when someone introduces themselves and respond with an appropriate courtesy phrase.
* **Can-Do (Cultural):** I can explain why most people in Spanish-speaking cultures carry two last names.

| Spanish | English | Spanish | English |

| **Me llamo…** | My name is… (I call myself) | **Igualmente** | Likewise |
| **Se llama…** | His/Her name is… | **¿Y tú? / ¿Y usted?** | And you? (Inf./Form.) |

### 🌍 Cultural Spotlight: Names & Introductions Across the Spanish-Speaking World



* **Spain 🇪🇸:** Customary responses are highly polite. In formal settings, you will hear **"El gusto es mío"** rather than just "Igualmente." Spaniards often move to first-name basis quickly, but the initial introduction remains polished.
* **Mexico 🇲🇽:** Youth culture is fast-paced. Informal introductions often skip the "Mucho gusto" and move straight to a handshake or a **"¡Qué onda!"** after hearing the name.
* **Argentina & Uruguay 🇦🇷🇺🇾:** Because of the *vos* pronoun, the question changes slightly to: **"¿Y vos, cómo te llamás?"** Notice the accent on the last 'a'. It is a distinct, respected regional melody.
* **The "Two Last Names" Rule:** In most Spanish-speaking countries, people carry two surnames: **[Father's first surname] + [Mother's first surname]**. For example, if Elena García and Luis López have a son named Juan, his full legal name is **Juan García López**.

### 📋 Activity Procedures & Teacher Guidance (Core Delivery)

| Time | Activity Title | Procedure & Instructional Details | Teacher Tips & Guidance | Examples |
|:---:|---|---|---|---|
| **5 min** | **Warm-Up: Time Check** | Quick review. Display 3 clocks. Students shout out the appropriate time-based greeting. | Reiterate *tardes* vs. *noches* transition. | **T:** 3:00 PM <br> **S:** "Buenas tardes" |
| **18 min** | **Input: Teacher CI Script** | Deliver the **Introduction & Formality** script (found below). Use a "Passport" prop for Argentina. | Use a different "voice" or posture for the Formal vs. Informal registers. | *"¿Cómo te llamas tú?" vs. "¿Cómo se llama usted?"* |
| **12 min** | **Practice: Interview Chain** | Students sit in a circle. Each introduces themselves to their neighbor and asks the neighbor's name. | Circulate to ensure students use "Igualmente" correctly. | **S1:** "Me llamo Alex. ¿Y tú?" <br> **S2:** "Me llamo Sam." |
| **8 min** | **Partner Writing** | Pairs write a 4-line dialogue between two characters (one formal, one informal). | Focus on the difference between *Mucho gusto* and *El gusto es mío*. | **Formal:** "Mucho gusto, Sr. Smith." |
| **7 min** | **Reflexión & Exit Ticket** | Discuss the two last names system. Exit Ticket: Write a formal intro to a principal and an informal intro to a friend. | Encourage students to "construct" their own Spanish double-surname. | **Ticket:** Me llamo [Name] [Dad's last] [Mom's last]. |

### 📘 Pedagogical Blueprint: How to Implement this Lesson

**1. The Reflexive Logic:**
Students often try to translate "My name is" literally (*Mi nombre es*). While correct, it's less common. Teach them that *Llamarse* means "To call oneself." Use the metaphor of a phone call: You are "calling" yourself a name.

**2. The Register Switch:**
Physicalize the difference between *Tú* and *Usted*. Stand tall and use a stiff handshake for *Usted*. Lean in and use a high-five or wave for *Tú*. This helps Novice learners "feel" the social difference before they master the grammar.

**3. Script for the Teacher (CI Model):**
> *[Walk in, looking confused as if meeting a stranger]*
> "¡Hola! Buenos días. Yo no sé... I don't know your name. **¿Cómo te llamas?** Cómo—how. Te llamas—you call yourself. [Point to self] **Me llamo Seño Bluemel.** Repeat: Me llamo... [Class repeats].
> 
> [Point to a student] ¿Y tú? ¿Cómo te llamas? [Student: Me llamo Ben]. Ben! ¡Mucho gusto! Much pleasure. Nice to meet you. [Model response] **Igualmente**. Same to you.
> 
> [Change posture, look serious] Now, I am a Boss. A Principal. Very formal. I don't say 'Te llamas.' I say: **¿Cómo se llama usted?** USTED. Respect. [Mime a formal handshake]. Mucho gusto, Señor. **El gusto es mío.** The pleasure is mine."

### 🚀 Differentiation & Enrichment

* **Support (Struggling):** Provide a sentence frame card: *¿Cómo te llamas? → Me llamo [Name]. Mucho gusto. → Igualmente.*
* **Enrichment (Achieving):** Challenge students to research a famous Latino (like Shakira or Lionel Messi) and identify their full "two last names" and where they come from.
* **Heritage Speakers:** Invite them to share how introductions work in their specific family culture—is it a handshake, a hug, or a kiss on the cheek?
* **ELL Support:** Connect "Igualmente" to "Equally" in English to help with the "Likewise" meaning through Latin roots.
