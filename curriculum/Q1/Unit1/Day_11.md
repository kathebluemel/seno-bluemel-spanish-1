### 📌 Standards Leadership & Alignment

**National Standards Alignment (Primary)**
*Grounded in the frameworks of **ACTFL, NCSSFL, AATSP, and JNCL-NCLIS**.*
- **Communication – Interpersonal:** Exchange age and numerical data in a personal context.
- **Communication – Interpretive:** Identify and decode numerical symbols (0-15) and their linguistic labels in Spanish.
- **Cultures – Practices:** Analyze the significance of the number *Quince* (15) as a cultural rite of passage in Latin America.
- **Comparisons – Language:** Identify the shared Latin roots between Spanish numbers and English academic vocabulary.
- **Comparisons – Grammar:** Contrast the "possessive" nature of age in Spanish (*Tener*) with the "existential" nature in English (*To Be*).

**NCSSFL-ACTFL Can-Do Statements**
> *I can count from 0-15 and use these numbers to state my age.*
> *I can use the structure "Tengo... años" correctly to express age.*
> *I can recognize English words that share roots with Spanish numbers (e.g., Trio, Duo).*

**Missouri CLEs (Secondary Alignment)**
- FL.1.A.1 — Use target language to share basic personal information including age.
- FL.4.A.1 — Identify cognate relationships between Spanish and English vocabulary.

### 🎯 Lesson Objectives (UbD Backward Design)

**Enduring Understanding:** Numbers are the universal language of data, but how we express our age reveals deep linguistic differences. In Spanish, age is a collection of years we "possess" rather than a state we "are."

**Essential Question:** How do numbers help us define our milestones and our identity?

### 📚 Vocabulary Focus: The Identity of Numbers

| Number | Spanish | English Cognate Root |
|---|---|---|
| **0 - 5** | Cero, Uno, Dos, Tres, Cuatro, Cinco | Uni- (One), Duo- (Two), Tri- (Three) |
| **6 - 10** | Seis, Siete, Ocho, Nueve, Diez | Octo- (Eight), Deca- (Ten) |
| **11 - 15** | Once, Doce, Trece, Catorce, **Quince** | Dozen (12), Quinceañera (15) |

**High-Frequency Identity Structures:**
* **¿Cuántos años tienes?** (How many years do you have?)
* **Tengo... años.** (I have... years.)
* **Años** (Years / Note the *tilde* ~ is essential for meaning!)

### 🌍 Cultural Spotlight: The Power of "Quince"

* **La Quinceañera (Bolivia/Latin America):** The number 15 is not just a digit; it is a cultural transition. A *Quinceañera* celebration is a major investment of family resources, marking a young woman's debut into the community.
* **Respecting the "Ancianos" (Peru):** In Andean cultures, high numbers in age represent high social capital. Elders are referred to with the formal *Usted* to honor the number of years they "possess."
* **Equatorial Guinea 🇬🇶:** This Spanish-speaking African nation celebrates its independence on October 12 (*Doce*). In this context, numbers mark the birth of a nation.

### 🕐 Lesson Timeline (50 Minutes)

**Warm-Up: The Cognate Connection (5 min)**
Teacher writes "Trio, Duo, Unicorn, October" on the board. Students must guess which Spanish numbers (1-10) are hidden inside those English words.

**Input: The "Possession of Time" CI Script (18 min)**
- Teacher mimes holding an invisible bag. "I don't ARE 30. I HAVE 30. [Mime putting years in a bag]. *Tengo treinta años.*"
- Practice counting 0-15 with rhythmic clapping.
- Focus on the **"kehn-seh"** (Quince) pronunciation—it is a high-frequency "trap" word for English speakers.

**Activity: The Human Bar Graph (12 min)**
Students stand in a line. Teacher calls out: *"¿Quién tiene trece años? ¿Catorce? ¿Quince?"* Students step forward to create a physical graph of the class's age distribution. They must say: *"Tengo ___ años"* as they step.

**Interactive Practice: Number "Buzz" (10 min)**
Class counts 0-15. On every prime number or multiple of 5, the student must say "¡Identidad!" instead of the number. This builds focus and numerical processing.

**Exit Ticket: The Mini-Bio (5 min)**
Write your name, your origin (Week 2), and your age using the correct *Tener* structure.

### 📺 Supplemental Resource Bank

> 🎬 **Watch:** Educators and students may visit the [Seño Bluemel Que Chévere YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvfq1AXJiDzXMV4VlA9ve_w?view_as=subscriber) for a video on "The Quinceañera Milestone" and a pronunciation guide for numbers 11-15, which are often the hardest for new learners to master!

---

### 📝 Scaffolding & Differentiation
- **Scaffolding:** Provide a "Root Map" showing how *Tres* becomes *Triangle* and *Ocho* becomes *Octopus*. 
- **Extension:** Students can calculate the age of a family member in Spanish: *"Mi hermano tiene doce años."*
- **Linguistic Note:** Remind students that *años* (years) and *anos* (a different body part) are different words—the squiggle (tilde) on the **ñ** is a "safety feature" of the language!
