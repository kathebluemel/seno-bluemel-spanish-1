*Unit 1 — ¡Hola, Mundo! | Week 3 | Quarter 1 | Day 11 of 171*

---

### 📌 Standards & Objectives

**ACTFL World-Readiness Standards (Primary)**
- **Communication – Interpersonal:** Use numbers 0–15 in simple spoken exchanges (age, phone numbers, classroom counts).
- **Communication – Interpretive:** Identify numbers 0–15 when heard in spoken Spanish and when seen in written form.
- **Communication – Presentational:** State one's age and recite a number sequence aloud with accurate pronunciation.
- **Cultures – Practices & Perspectives:** Recognize that numbers appear differently in cultural contexts — dates, addresses, and ages carry different social weight in different cultures.
- **Comparisons – Language:** Notice that some Spanish number words share roots with English (cognates: *uno/unit, dos/duo, tres/trio*).

**NCSSFL-ACTFL Can-Do Statements**
> *I can recognize and say numbers 0–15 in Spanish.*
> *I can tell someone how old I am using* tengo ___ años.
> *I can count objects and people around me using Spanish numbers.*

**Missouri CLEs (Secondary)**
- FL.1.A.1 — Use target language to share basic personal information including age.
- FL.1.A.3 — Present numerical information in the target language.
- FL.4.A.1 — Identify cognate relationships between Spanish and English number vocabulary.

### 🎯 Lesson Objectives (UbD Backward Design)

**Enduring Understanding:** Numbers are not just math — they are personal (your age, your birthday, your address) and cultural (how a society records time, celebrates milestones, and structures daily life).

**Essential Question:** What can a number tell you about a person — or a culture?

**Transfer Goal (toward Day 15 IPA):** Students will use numbers accurately in a birthday conversation: *¿Cuántos años tienes? Tengo ___ años. ¿Cuándo es tu cumpleaños?*

### 📚 Vocabulary Focus

| Number | Spanish | Pronunciation Tip |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | cero | *SEH-roh* |
| 1 | uno | *OO-noh* |
| 2 | dos | *dohs* |
| 3 | tres | *trehs* |
| 4 | cuatro | *KWAH-troh* |
| 5 | cinco | *SEEN-koh* |
| 6 | seis | *says* |
| 7 | siete | *SYEH-teh* |
| 8 | ocho | *OH-choh* |
| 9 | nueve | *NWEH-beh* |
| 10 | diez | *dyehs* |
| 11 | once | *OHN-seh* |
| 12 | doce | *DOH-seh* |
| 13 | trece | *TREH-seh* |
| 14 | catorce | *kah-TOR-seh* |
| 15 | quince | *KEEN-seh* |

**New Structures:**
| Spanish | English |
|---|---|
| ¿Cuántos años tienes? | How old are you? |
| Tengo ___ años. | I am ___ years old. (lit: I have ___ years) |
| ¿Cuántos años tiene usted? | How old are you? (formal) |
| Tengo ___ años también. | I am also ___ years old. |

**Grammar Note (input-only):** Spanish says *tengo* (I have) years — not *soy* (I am). Age uses *tener* (to have), not *ser* (to be). This is another case where Spanish and English think about the same thing differently.

### 🌍 Cultural Spotlight: Numbers, Age & Milestone Birthdays

**Bolivia 🇧🇴** — In Bolivia, the **quinceañera** — the celebration of a girl's 15th birthday — is one of the most important cultural milestones in Latin American life. The number *quince* (15) is deeply meaningful. Families save for years for this celebration, which marks the transition from childhood to womanhood. It combines Catholic tradition with indigenous celebration depending on the region.

**Peru 🇵🇪** — In many Peruvian communities, particularly in the Andes, age is not just a number but a marker of communal role. Elders (*los ancianos*) are given profound respect — asking *¿Cuántos años tiene usted?* of an elder is an act of honoring their wisdom, not just curiosity. The Quechua-influenced cultures of the Andes count time and age in relationship to harvests and seasons, not just calendar years.

**Equatorial Guinea 🇬🇶** — Equatorial Guinea is the **only Spanish-speaking country in Africa** — and one of the least-known members of the Spanish-speaking world. It gained independence from Spain on **October 12, 1968** — the same date as the pan-Hispanic holiday *El Día de la Hispanidad*. The number 12 (*doce*) and the month of October are culturally significant there. Spanish coexists with French and indigenous Fang and Bubi languages.

**Missouri Connection 🇺🇸** — Americans celebrate the 16th birthday (driving), the 18th (voting), and the 21st (legal adulthood). Compare these with the Latin American *quinceañera* at 15 — what do different cultures choose to celebrate, and why those numbers?

### 🕐 Lesson Timeline (50 Minutes)

**Warm-Up / Activador (5 min)**
Quick Week 2 review: Teacher asks 5 students: *¿Cómo te llamas? ¿De dónde eres? ¿Cómo estás?* Students respond with full sentences. Then: *"Today — nueva semana, new week. We're going to COUNT."*

**Input: Teacher-Led CI Script (18 min)**

> *[Hold up fingers as you count — big, theatrical, slow.]*
>
> "Clase — vamos a contar. To count. Contar. Uno. [One finger.] Dos. [Two.] Tres. [Three.] ¿Cuántos dedos? How many fingers? TRES. Tres dedos. Three fingers."
>
> *[Keep going to 10, with the class joining in.]*
>
> "Cuatro. Cinco. Seis. Siete. Ocho. Nueve. Diez. [Hold up all 10 fingers.] ¡Diez! Ten. Diez dedos. Ten fingers. ¿Cuántos dedos tenemos todos? [Point to whole class.] Many, many dedos."
>
> *[Now slow down and point to the number-cognate connection.]*
>
> "Wait — listen. UNO. In English — UNIform. UNIted. UNIverse. ONE. Uno. Uno — uni — one. The same ROOT. ¿Interesante, verdad?"
>
> *[Write on board: uno → uni / dos → duo / tres → trio]*
>
> "DOS. In English — DUO. Two people. Two. DOS. TRES — TRIO. Three. Tres. These words are RELATED. Spanish and English share Latin roots. Cognates — cognados — are your friends."
>
> *[Continue to 15 with exaggerated pronunciation, class repeating after each.]*
>
> "Once — eleven. Doce — twelve. Like a dozen! Una docena — a dozen — doce — twelve. ¿Una docena de qué? A dozen of what? Huevos — eggs! Una docena de huevos — twelve eggs. Doce. Twelve."
>
> *[Now shift to age.]*
>
> "Now — ¿cuántos AÑOS tienes? Años — years. ¿Cuántos años — how many years — tienes — do you have? In Spanish, age is something you HAVE. Tengo. I HAVE. Not 'I am 14' — in Spanish: TENGO catorce años. I HAVE fourteen years."
>
> *[Point to yourself.]*
>
> "¿Cuántos años TENGO yo? [Pause dramatically.] Hmm. In Colombia, it's not polite to ask a señorita her age! [Laugh.] But I'll tell you — for learning purposes — tengo ___ años. ¿Y tú? ¿Cuántos años tienes tú?"
>
> *[Take 4–5 student responses. Write them on the board: Tengo ___ años.]*
>
> "Look — most of you are in the range of... catorce — fourteen. Quince — fifteen. Some of you: trece — thirteen. All single-digit responses from our vocabulary today. ¡Perfecto!"
>
> *[Introduce the Bolivia cultural hook.]*
>
> "QUINCE. Fifteen. In Bolivia — and across Latin America — QUINCE is a MAGIC number for girls. The quinceañera — the fiesta of the fifteenth birthday — is one of the biggest celebrations of a person's life. Families plan for YEARS. It's not just a birthday — it's a cultural milestone. QUINCE."

**Guided Practice: Number Activities (12 min)**

*Activity 1 — Buzz Count (4 min):* Class counts 1–15 around the room. Every time someone reaches a multiple of 5 (*cinco, diez, quince*), they say *¡BUZZ!* instead of the number. Keeps everyone alert and listening.

*Activity 2 — Age Survey (8 min):* Students stand and find 3 classmates. For each: ask *¿Cuántos años tienes?* and record their response. Then sit and write 3 sentences: *[Name] tiene ___ años.*

**Exit Ticket (5 min)**
Students write numbers 0–15 in Spanish from memory. Then write: *Tengo ___ años.* Teacher collects — use as a quick diagnostic for pronunciation and spelling gaps.

### 📺 Seño Bluemel Resource

> 🎬 **Watch:** Visit [youtube.com/@SenoBluemelQueChevere](https://youtube.com/@SenoBluemelQueChevere) for a numbers pronunciation video — hear how *siete, nueve,* and *quince* sound in natural Colombian Spanish. Also look for any calendar or counting songs to reinforce 0–15 before tomorrow!

### 📝 Scaffolding & Differentiation Notes

- **Scaffolding:** Provide a number reference strip (0–15) taped to students' desks for the first two days of Week 3. Remove by Day 13.
- **Extension:** Students research the quinceañera tradition in one specific country (Bolivia, Mexico, Cuba) and write 3 sentences in Spanish about what happens at the celebration.
- **IPA Connection:** *Tengo ___ años* is a required structure in the Day 15 birthday conversation IPA.
