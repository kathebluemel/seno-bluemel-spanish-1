### 📌 Standards Leadership & Alignment

**National Standards Alignment (Primary)**
*Grounded in the frameworks of **ACTFL, NCSSFL, AATSP, and JNCL-NCLIS**.*
- **Communication – Interpersonal:** Demonstrate strategic competence in multi-turn greetings, origin exchanges, and emotional check-ins.
- **Communication – Interpretive:** Extract and synthesize biographical data from authentic-style listening and reading prompts.
- **Communication – Presentational:** Refine a personal narrative (identity profile) that incorporates Week 1–2 proficiency benchmarks.
- **Cultures – Practices:** Select the appropriate linguistic register and regionalisms based on the origin of the interlocutor.

**NCSSFL-ACTFL Can-Do Statements**
> *I can maintain a connected conversation by greeting, sharing my origin, and describing my state of being.*
> *I can switch between formal and informal registers based on social cues.*
> *I can identify regional markers (like 'Vos' or 'Chévere') to determine a speaker's background.*

**Missouri CLEs (Secondary Alignment)**
- FL.1.A.1 — Use target language in simple, multi-topic conversations.
- FL.4.A.1 — Apply cultural knowledge to linguistically appropriate register choices.

### 🎯 Lesson Objectives (UbD Backward Design)

**Enduring Understanding:** Proficiency is a performance, not a test. Professional communicators rehearse the "basics" until they become intuitive strategies.

**Essential Question:** How do I synthesize my linguistic tools to navigate a real-world encounter with a global citizen?

### 📚 Strategic Vocabulary Synthesis: The Identity Toolkit



**The Core Structures:**
* **Essence (Ser):** *Me llamo... / Soy de... / Es de...*
* **Condition (Estar):** *Estoy... / ¿Cómo está usted? / Está...*
* **Register Cues:** *¿Qué onda? (MX) / ¿Cómo andás? (AR) / ¿Cómo amaneció? (CO)*

### 🌍 Cultural Spotlight: Reading the Room (Code-Switching)

Today’s focus is on **Sociolinguistic Agility**—the ability to adapt your Spanish based on the "Country Cue":

1.  **Mexico (Peer):** Casual, fast, uses *¿Qué onda?* or *¡Qué padre!*
2.  **Colombia (Professional/Elder):** Formal, utilizes *Usted* heavily, uses *Mucho gusto* and *Que le vaya bien*.
3.  **Argentina (Informal):** Utilizes *Voseo* (*¿De dónde sos?*). Expect warmth but a distinct linguistic rhythm.

### 🕐 Lesson Timeline (50 Minutes)

**Warm-Up: The Register Blitz (8 min)**
Teacher flashes images of people (e.g., a grandmother in Spain, a teenager in Mexico, a businessman in Colombia). Students must immediately shout the correct greeting and register (*Tú/Vos/Usted*).

**Input: The Airport Arrival Simulation (12 min)**
- Teacher mimes arriving at an international airport. "I just landed in Bogotá. I am tired (*estoy cansado*). I meet an official."
- Practice the shift: "Buenos días. Soy de los Estados Unidos. ¿Cómo está usted?"
- Then, switch to meeting a fellow traveler: "¡Hola! ¿De dónde eres? Yo soy de Missouri."
- **Key Strategy:** If you don't know a word, use gestures or a cognate.

**The Strategy Circuit (20 min — 4 Stations)**

* **Station 1: Writing Lab:** Draft an 8-line script for the "International Summit" scenario.
* **Station 2: Fluency Lab:** Partners practice "Speed Dating" introductions. Goal: 30 seconds of continuous Spanish without English "umms."
* **Station 3: Decoding Lab:** Read three short "Passenger Profiles" and identify who is formal, who is informal, and where they are from.
* **Station 4: Cultural Logic:** Match "Greeting Audio/Text Clips" to the correct flag/country on the map.

**IPA Debrief & Rubric Review (7 min)**
Teacher displays the **Day 10 IPA Rubric**. We discuss what "Proficiency" looks like: it's not about being perfect; it's about being **understood**.

**Exit Ticket: The Confidence Check (3 min)**
Students write one linguistic "win" they had this week and one "target" they want to nail during tomorrow's assessment.

Reviewing the regional greetings tonight will significantly boost your "Cultural Accuracy" score tomorrow!

### 📝 Scaffolding & Differentiation
- **Scaffolding:** Provide "Communication Survival Cards" with phrases like *¿Cómo se dice?* or *Repita, por favor* for use during the Strategy Circuit.
- **Extension:** Students can draft a "Welcome Speech" for a visitor from a country not covered in class, incorporating researched regionalisms.
- **IPA Connection:** This entire lesson is a high-fidelity rehearsal of the three modes (Interpretive, Interpersonal, Presentational) that will be assessed on Day 10.
