### 🎯 Lesson Objectives (UbD Backward Design)

**Enduring Understanding:** Fluency grows through rehearsal — professional athletes practice the fundamentals before the game, and language learners do the same.

**Essential Question:** What does it feel like to speak Spanish confidently — and how do you get there?

**Transfer Goal:** Students consolidate all Week 1–2 language into a coherent, confident performance in preparation for tomorrow's Day 10 IPA.

### 🌍 Cultural Spotlight: Putting It All Together — Who Are You Talking To?

Today's cultural focus is on **code-switching** — the skill of reading your interlocutor and selecting the right register, greeting, and vocabulary.

**The Key Questions Before You Speak:**
1. How old is this person relative to me?
2. Do I know them — or are they a stranger?
3. What country are they from — and does that affect the words they use?
4. Is this a formal or informal setting?

**Country Cue Cards (for today's practice):**

> **Mexico 🇲🇽 — Young peer, informal:** Use *Hola / ¿Qué onda? / ¿De dónde eres? / Estoy bien.* Farewells: *¡Chao!*

> **Colombia 🇨🇴 — Adult, formal:** Use *Buenos días / ¿Cómo está usted? / ¿De dónde es usted? / Mucho gusto.* Farewells: *Que le vaya bien.*

> **Argentina 🇦🇷 — Peer, informal:** Expect *vos* forms. Use *¡Buenas! / ¿De dónde sos? / ¿Cómo estás?* Farewells: *¡Chau!*

> **Puerto Rico 🇵🇷 — Peer, informal:** Use *¡Hola! / ¿Cómo estás? / ¿De dónde eres?* Listen for *¡Wepa!* as an expression of excitement. Match their energy.

### 🕐 Lesson Timeline (50 Minutes)

**Warm-Up / Activador: Vocabulary Blitz (8 min)**
Teacher displays flashcard-style prompts on the board (one every 20 seconds). Students write or call out the Spanish translation. Mix of vocabulary, grammar cues (*Which verb — ser or estar?*), and cultural prompts (*"How do you say 'cool' in Puerto Rico?"*). Keep it fast and fun — this is low-stakes review energy.

**Input: CI Script — The Airport Scene (12 min)**

> *[Set the scene: Mime walking through an airport, pulling a rolling suitcase, looking around with wide eyes.]*
>
> "Clase — imagine. You are in an AIRPORT. El aeropuerto. You have just landed — llegaste — you arrived — in a Spanish-speaking country. And someone walks up to you. [Mime a stranger approaching.] They say:"
>
> *[Use a warm, curious voice.]*
>
> "¡Hola! ¿Cómo te llamas? ¿De dónde eres? ¿Cómo estás — estás bien después del vuelo? [Mime tired from a long flight.] — After the flight? Are you okay?"
>
> *[Pause. Look at class.]*
>
> "What do you say? You know this. You have everything you need. [Count on fingers.] Me llamo ___. Soy de Missouri, de los Estados Unidos. Estoy cansado/a — the flight was long — pero estoy bien."
>
> *[Respond as the stranger.]*
>
> "¡Bienvenido/a! Mucho gusto. Soy de aquí — de Buenos Aires. ¡Buenas! ¿Qué tal tu viaje?"
>
> *[Break character. Turn to class.]*
>
> "¿Qué tal? — What's up with — tu viaje — your trip? Another way to ask How are you — about a situation. ¿Qué tal? You'll hear this everywhere."
>
> *[Write on board: ¿Qué tal? = How's it going? / How was it?]*
>
> "Okay — airport scene, round two. This time — your stranger is FORMAL. Older. Colombian. They say: Buenos días. ¿Cómo está usted? ¿De dónde es usted?"
>
> *[Gesture to students — they supply the formal response aloud together.]*
>
> "Usted. Formal. Register shift. You read the room — you read the PERSON — and you choose. That is communicative competence. That is what tomorrow's IPA asks you to do."

**Stations Review (20 min — 4 stations, 5 min each)**

**Station 1 — Writing:** Students write a complete 8-line dialogue using all Week 2 themes. Can use notes.

**Station 2 — Speaking:** Partners perform the dialogue from Day 8 graphic organizer. Goal: zero pauses, natural delivery. Time themselves.

**Station 3 — Interpretive:** Students read a short paragraph about a fictional Spanish speaker (provided on a card) and answer 4 comprehension questions: name, origin, feeling, one cultural detail.

**Station 4 — Cultural Match:** 8 scenario cards + 4 country profile cards. Students match each scenario (e.g., "Your interlocutor says *¿Cómo andás?*") to the correct country and explain why.

**IPA Preview & Q&A (7 min)**
Teacher walks through tomorrow's IPA format explicitly: three tasks, rubric criteria, what "meeting expectations" looks like. Students ask questions. Normalize nerves — *Estoy nervioso/a es perfectamente normal.*

**Exit Ticket (3 min)**
Students write the one thing they feel most confident about going into the IPA — and the one thing they want to review tonight.

### 📝 Scaffolding & Differentiation Notes

- **Scaffolding:** Provide a "Week 2 Study Card" — a single index card with all key structures listed. Students may use it during Station 1 (writing) only, not during speaking stations.
- **Extension:** Students create their own "Country Cue Card" for a Spanish-speaking country not covered this week, researching one greeting norm and one emotional expression unique to that country.
- **IPA Connection:** Every activity today is a direct dress rehearsal for the Day 10 IPA. Treat the stations as low-stakes practice runs with the same expectations as tomorrow.
