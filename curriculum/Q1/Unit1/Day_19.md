### 🎯 IPA Design Overview (UbD — Stage 1 Transfer, Final)

**Enduring Understanding:** Language is identity. When you speak Spanish — however imperfectly, however early in your journey — you are joining a global conversation that has been happening for centuries across 21 countries and over 500 million lives. Your passport into that conversation is your own voice.

**Essential Question:** Who are you in the Spanish-speaking world — and who do you want to become?

**Performance Task Today:**
- **Presentational Task** — Finalize and deliver the Identity Passport as a complete, polished spoken + written self-introduction.

### 🌍 Cultural Spotlight: The 21 Countries — A Unit Farewell

Before the final presentations, open with a brief, celebratory tour of the Spanish-speaking world — honoring every country that appeared in Unit 1 and naming those the class didn't fully explore. This ritual closing signals to students that their learning is the beginning of a relationship with a vast human community, not the completion of a checklist.

**The Full 21 — A Final Roll Call:**

> *Teacher reads each country aloud. Students who feel a personal connection — heritage, curiosity, or a specific memory from Unit 1 — raise their hand.*

México 🇲🇽 · Guatemala 🇬🇹 · Honduras 🇭🇳 · El Salvador 🇸🇻 · Nicaragua 🇳🇮 · Costa Rica 🇨🇷 · Panamá 🇵🇦 · Cuba 🇨🇺 · República Dominicana 🇩🇴 · Puerto Rico 🇵🇷 · Venezuela 🇻🇪 · Colombia 🇨🇴 · Ecuador 🇪🇨 · Perú 🇵🇪 · Bolivia 🇧🇴 · Chile 🇨🇱 · Argentina 🇦🇷 · Uruguay 🇺🇾 · Paraguay 🇵🇾 · España 🇪🇸 · Guinea Ecuatorial 🇬🇶

**Teacher Closing Statement (read aloud or adapt):**
> *"Twenty-one countries. Hundreds of millions of people. Dozens of indigenous languages still spoken alongside Spanish. Caribbean rhythms, Andean mountains, African heritage, European cathedrals, tropical rainforests, Patagonian glaciers. This is the world you are learning to enter. You have been studying for nineteen days. You have barely scratched the surface — and that is the most exciting thing I can tell you."*

### 📋 IPA Task 3: Presentational — Identity Passport (Full Period)

**The Identity Passport — Final Requirements:**

Students finalize and submit their Identity Passport as both a **physical/digital document** and a **spoken presentation** (60–90 seconds).

---

**Written Component (submitted as document artifact):**

The passport must include ALL of the following, written correctly in Spanish:

**Section 1 — Personal Identity**
- Full name: *Me llamo ___.*
- Origin: *Soy de ___, [city], [state/country].*
- Age: *Tengo ___ años.*
- Birthday in full Spanish words: *Mi cumpleaños es el ___ de ___.*
- Birthday in Spanish numeric format: *(DD/MM/YYYY)*
- Current emotional state: *Hoy estoy ___.*

**Section 2 — Cultural Connection**
- One Spanish-speaking country that interests you: *Un país hispanohablante que me interesa es ___.*
- One cultural fact or practice from that country: *En ___, la gente ___. / Una tradición especial es ___.*
- Why it interests you (may be in English for Novice-Low): *This interests me because ___.*

**Section 3 — My Greeting**
- Favorite greeting learned in Unit 1: *Mi saludo favorito es ___.*
- One regional expression and its country: *___ es una expresión de ___. Significa ___.*

**Section 4 — Self-Portrait & Design**
- A self-portrait (drawing or photo) with a flag or symbol of a Spanish-speaking country the student feels connected to.
- The passport is designed, decorated, and treated as a real document — because it is. It goes into the Unit 1 portfolio.

---

**Spoken Component (60–90 seconds, delivered to the class, a partner, or recorded):**

Students deliver their self-introduction aloud using the passport as a reference — not a script to read verbatim. The goal is confident, natural delivery. Teacher or peer evaluates using the presentational rubric column.

*Suggested spoken structure:*
1. Open with a greeting appropriate to the time of day.
2. Introduce yourself — name, origin, age, birthday.
3. Share how you're feeling today and why.
4. Share your cultural connection — the country, the tradition, why it matters to you.
5. Close with your favorite Unit 1 greeting or expression.

*Model opening (teacher demonstrates):*
> *"Buenos días. Me llamo Seño Bluemel. Soy de Barranquilla, Colombia — una ciudad en el Caribe, muy alegre, muy musical. Tengo ___ años y mi cumpleaños es el ___ de ___. Hoy estoy muy contenta — y muy orgullosa — porque mis estudiantes acaban de terminar la Unidad 1. Un país que me encanta es Guinea Ecuatorial — el único país hispanohablante de África. Es fascinante porque conecta la herencia española con las culturas africanas tradicionales. Mi expresión favorita de esta unidad es: ¡Chévere! — porque es de mi casa. Buenos días y gracias."*

### 🕐 Lesson Timeline (50 Minutes)

| Time | Activity |
|---|---|
| 0–8 min | Final Roll Call of the 21 Countries + Teacher closing statement (cultural celebration) |
| 8–18 min | Passport finalization work time — quiet, individual. Teacher circulates for last-minute coaching |

| 45–48 min | Unit 1 Reflection — written exit reflection (see below) |

---

### ✍️ Unit 1 Exit Reflection

Students write (in English) a brief reflection to close Unit 1:

```
Unit 1 Reflection — ¡Hola, Mundo!

1. The most surprising thing I learned in Unit 1 was:

2. The Spanish-speaking country I most want to learn more about is:
   _______________ because:

3. The moment in this unit when I felt most confident speaking Spanish was:

4. One thing I want to get better at before the end of the year is:

5. Complete this sentence in Spanish:
   Soy _______________ y estoy listo/a para la Unidad 2.
```

Teacher collects reflections. Use student responses to inform Unit 2 pacing, cultural focus choices, and differentiation groupings.

---

### 🎉 Unit Closing Celebration

Before dismissal, lead the class in one final whole-group activity: **La Cadena de Saludos** — The Greeting Chain.

Standing in a circle, each student greets the person to their right with any Unit 1 greeting of their choice — formal, informal, regional, or a cultural expression. The only rule: no two students can use the exact same greeting. The chain continues until every student has greeted and been greeted.

*When the chain completes, teacher says:*
> *"Eso es español. That is Spanish. Twenty-something different ways to say hello — from twenty-something different places in the world — and you know all of them. Unidad 1: ¡completa! ¡Chévere!"*

### 📝 Teacher Notes: Portfolio, Scoring & Unit 2 Transition

**Portfolio Artifacts — Unit 1 Complete Collection:**
- Day 1: Desk Passport (*El Pasaporte Inicial*)
- Day 10: Welcome Assembly Introduction (Presentational writing)
- Day 15: International Birthday Profile Card
- Day 18: Interpretive comprehension task + Interpersonal rubric score
- Day 19: Identity Passport (written document + spoken presentation score)

**Summative IPA Scoring:** Combine Day 18 rubric scores (Interpretive + Interpersonal) with Day 19 rubric scores (Presentational) for the complete Unit 1 summative IPA grade. Weight distribution is teacher/department discretion — a suggested split is 40% Interpretive, 30% Interpersonal, 30% Presentational.

**Data to Carry into Unit 2:**
- Students still struggling with *ser vs. estar* → priority re-teach in Unit 2 grammar input
- Students with weak number fluency (16–29) → embed in Unit 2 age/phone number activities
- Students who showed strong cultural curiosity → candidates for enrichment cultural research projects
- Heritage speakers who shared family traditions → invite as cultural consultants in Unit 2 discussions

**Unit 2 Preview:** *El Alfabeto, La Clase, y Las Descripciones* — the alphabet, classroom vocabulary, and physical/personality descriptions. Students will learn to spell names, describe themselves and others, and navigate the school environment in Spanish.
