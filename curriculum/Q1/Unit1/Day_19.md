### 🎯 IPA Design Overview (UbD — Stage 1 Transfer, Final)

**Enduring Understanding:** Language is identity. When you speak Spanish, you are joining a global conversation that spans 21 countries and over 500 million lives. Your passport into that conversation is your own voice.

**Essential Question:** Who are you in the Spanish-speaking world—and who do you want to become?

### 🌍 Cultural Spotlight: The 21 Countries — A Global Farewell

Before the final presentations, the class conducts a celebratory "Roll Call" of the 21 Spanish-speaking countries. This ritual signals that learning is the beginning of a relationship with a vast human community, not the completion of a checklist. 

**Teacher Closing Statement:** *"Twenty-one countries. Hundreds of millions of people. From the Caribbean rhythms to the Andean mountains and Equatorial Guinea’s unique African-Hispanic heritage—this is the world you are learning to enter. You have been studying for nineteen days; you have only just begun."*

### 📋 IPA Task 3: Presentational — Identity Passport (Full Period)

Students finalize and submit their **Identity Passport** as both a physical/digital document and a spoken presentation (60–90 seconds).

**Written Component Requirements:**
1. **Personal Identity:** Name, Origin, Age, Birthday (Full words + DD/MM/YYYY), and Emotional State.
2. **Cultural Connection:** Identification of an interesting Spanish-speaking country and a specific cultural fact or practice.
3. **Regional Expression:** A favorite greeting and a regional expression learned (e.g., *¡Wepa!*, *¡Guay!*, or *¡Chévere!*).
4. **Visual Design:** A self-portrait and a symbol/flag of a connected Spanish-speaking country.

**Spoken Component:**
Students deliver a natural self-introduction using their passport as a reference. The goal is confident delivery that honors the cultural nuances of their chosen region.
