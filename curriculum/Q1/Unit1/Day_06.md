### 🎯 Lesson Objectives (UbD Backward Design)

**Enduring Understanding:** Where you are from shapes how you see the world — and in Spanish, telling someone your origin is one of the most personal and culturally rich things you can share.

**Essential Question:** Is "where you're from" just a location — or is it also an identity?

**Transfer Goal (toward Week 2 IPA, Day 10):** Students will ask and answer origin questions in a simulated "International Meet & Greet," combining Week 1 greetings with Week 2 origin language.

### 🌍 Cultural Spotlight: Origin as Identity

**Colombia 🇨🇴** — Colombians often identify strongly with their *region* as much as their country. Someone from Barranquilla is *costeño* (coastal). Someone from Bogotá is *rolo* or *cachaco*. These regional identities carry cultural pride and even friendly rivalry — similar to Missouri vs. Kansas!

**Mexico 🇲🇽** — Mexico is vast — 31 states, dozens of indigenous languages still spoken today. A person from Oaxaca and a person from Monterrey may have very different cultural traditions, foods, and even accents. *Soy de México* can mean many things.

**Puerto Rico 🇵🇷** — Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory, meaning Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens — but their language, culture, and identity are deeply Spanish Caribbean. A student from Puerto Rico might say *Soy de Puerto Rico* AND *Soy de los Estados Unidos* — both are true. This is a powerful discussion point about complex identity.

**Argentina 🇦🇷** — Argentina has a large population of Italian and Spanish immigrant descendants. An Argentine might say *Soy de Argentina pero mis abuelos son de Italia* — "I'm from Argentina but my grandparents are from Italy." Origin can be layered.

**Missouri Connection 🇺🇸** — Students can practice: *Soy de Missouri. Soy de [city].* Ask: Is everyone in this room from Missouri? From the same city? Origin is personal and varied — even within one classroom.

### 🕐 Lesson Timeline (50 Minutes)

**Warm-Up / Activador (5 min)**
Quick Week 1 review: Teacher greets 5 students with a time-appropriate greeting, asks *¿Cómo te llamas?* and *¿Cómo estás?* Students respond. Fast-paced, energetic, no writing.

**Input: Teacher-Led CI Script (18 min)**

> *[Stand beside the world map. Point to Colombia with enthusiasm.]*
>
> "Buenos días, clase. ¿Cómo están todos hoy? Bien — good. I have a question for you. A pregunta. ¿De dónde eres? — WHERE — de dónde — are you from — eres? ¿De DÓNDE ERES?"
>
> *[Point to yourself.]*
>
> "Yo soy de Colombia. SOY — I am — DE — from — Colombia. Soy de Colombia. Soy de Barranquilla, Colombia. ¿Y tú? ¿De dónde eres tú?"
>
> *[Point to a student. Cup your ear.]*
>
> "You say: Soy de ___. Soy de Missouri. Soy de Arnold. Soy de St. Louis. Whatever your city — your ciudad — soy de [ciudad]. Go ahead — tell your neighbor. ¿De dónde eres? Soy de ___. Go."
>
> *[30-second partner turn. Bring focus back.]*
>
> "Now — class — is everyone from the same place? [Look around dramatically.] No. Different cities. Diferentes ciudades. In this classroom, we have MANY origins. Muchos orígenes."
>
> *[Point to the map — Puerto Rico.]*
>
> "Look at this island. Puerto Rico. It's HERE — in the Caribbean Sea. [Trace the Caribbean.] Puerto Rico is part of the United States — but the language is Spanish. The culture is Spanish Caribbean. If someone is from Puerto Rico, they say: Soy de Puerto Rico. AND they can say: Soy de los Estados Unidos. Both. True. Identity is complex."
>
> *[Move to Mexico.]*
>
> "México — the LARGEST Spanish-speaking country in the world by population. Thirty-one states. Someone from Oaxaca [point] and someone from Monterrey [point] — same country, very different culture. Soy de México can mean many things."
>
> *[Now model a full exchange.]*
>
> "Watch me. I'll be two people. [Step left.] ¡Hola! ¿De dónde eres? [Step right.] Soy de Argentina. ¿Y tú? [Step left.] Soy de Colombia. ¡Mucho gusto! [Step right.] Igualmente."
>
> *[Turn to class.]*
>
> "Simple. Beautiful. That's a REAL conversation in Spanish. Four sentences. You can already do this. ¿Listos? Ready? Let's practice."

**Guided Practice: World Map Introductions (12 min)**
Teacher displays a large digital or printed map. Call out a country — students stand up and say *Soy de [país]* as if they were from there. Rotate quickly through 8–10 countries. Then: students pick *any* Spanish-speaking country, write *Soy de ___* on a sticky note, and place it on the map. Class does a quick scan — which country got the most picks?

**Pair Practice: Origin Dialogue (10 min)**
Partners practice a 6-line dialogue:
1. Greeting (Week 1 vocab — appropriate to time of day)
2. Name exchange
3. *¿De dónde eres?* / *Soy de ___.*
4. *¿Y tú?* / Response
5. *Mucho gusto* exchange
6. Farewell

Teacher circulates. Students who finish early try the formal version (*¿De dónde es usted?*).

**Exit Ticket (5 min)**
Students write: (1) *Soy de ___* using their real origin. (2) One fact they learned about a Spanish-speaking country's sense of regional identity.

### 📺 Seño Bluemel Resource

> 🎬 **Watch:** Visit [youtube.com/@SenoBluemelQueChevere](https://youtube.com/@SenoBluemelQueChevere) for a video on Spanish-speaking countries and origin expressions — hear how *soy de* sounds in different accents from Colombia, Mexico, and beyond. Great pre-study for the Week 2 IPA!

### 📝 Scaffolding & Differentiation Notes

- **Scaffolding:** Post a labeled world map anchor chart with all country names spelled out. Students may reference it during all activities this week.
- **Extension:** Students write 3 sentences about a fictional character from a Spanish-speaking country: name, origin, and one cultural detail.
- **Heritage Speakers:** Invite students to share their own origin story in Spanish — model that *Soy de ___* can include cities, regions, and even dual identities.
