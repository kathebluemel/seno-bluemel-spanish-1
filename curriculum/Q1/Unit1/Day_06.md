### 📌 Standards Leadership & Alignment

**National Standards Alignment (Primary)**
*Grounded in the frameworks of **ACTFL, NCSSFL, AATSP, and JNCL-NCLIS**.*
- **Communication – Interpersonal:** Ask and answer questions about origin and national identity.
- **Communication – Interpretive:** Identify country names and origin markers in spoken and written input.
- **Cultures – Perspectives:** Recognize that national origin is a multi-layered identity marker (Regional vs. National vs. Global).
- **Comparisons – Language:** Compare how origin is expressed in Spanish (*ser* + *de*) versus English syntax.
- **Connections – Global Literacy:** Apply geographic knowledge to locate 21 Spanish-speaking nations and territories.

**NCSSFL-ACTFL Can-Do Statements**
> *I can state my origin using the structure "Soy de...".*
> *I can ask someone about their origin using "¿De dónde eres?" and "¿De dónde es usted?".*
> *I can locate several Spanish-speaking countries on a global map.*

**Missouri CLEs (Secondary Alignment)**
- FL.1.A.1 — Engage in simple conversations regarding personal background.
- FL.2.A.1 — Identify geographic information about Spanish-speaking countries.

### 🎯 Lesson Objectives (UbD Backward Design)

**Enduring Understanding:** Origin is more than a location; it is a narrative of heritage. In the Spanish-speaking world, "Where are you from?" is the beginning of a deep cultural exchange.

**Essential Question:** How does my origin contribute to my identity within a global community?

### 📚 Vocabulary Focus: The Language of Origin

| Structure | Context | English |
|---|---|---|
| **¿De dónde eres?** | Informal (*tú*) | Where are you from? |
| **¿De dónde es usted?** | Formal (*usted*) | Where are you from? |
| **Soy de...** | Personal Identity | I am from... |
| **Es de...** | Third-person | He/She is from... |
| **El país / La ciudad** | Geography | The country / The city |

**Regional Literacy (High-Frequency):**
México, Colombia, España, Guinea Ecuatorial, Argentina, Puerto Rico, Estados Unidos.

### 🌍 Cultural Spotlight: Layers of Origin

* **Regional Pride:** In **Colombia**, regional identity (*Costeño, Paisa, Rolo*) is often as strong as national identity. This mirrors the "Midwest vs. Coast" identities in the U.S.
* **Territorial Complexity:** **Puerto Rico** is a U.S. territory; inhabitants are U.S. citizens but maintain a distinct, vibrant Spanish-Caribbean national identity.
* **The African Connection:** **Equatorial Guinea** is the only Spanish-speaking country in Africa, representing a unique synthesis of African and Hispanic identity.
* **Heritage Language:** Many Spanish speakers in the **U.S.** identify as "Spanish-speaking" even if their families have lived in the states for generations—identity is linguistic as well as geographic.

### 🕐 Lesson Timeline (50 Minutes)

**Warm-Up: Global Roll Call (5 min)**
Teacher calls out 5 different countries. Students respond with a greeting they think fits that region (e.g., "Argentina" -> "¡Buenas!", "Mexico" -> "¡Qué onda!").

**Input: The "Origin Story" CI Script (18 min)**
- Teacher uses a world map to model origin. "Yo soy de Colombia. [Point to map]. I am FROM Colombia."
- Explain the **Ser + De** formula. *Ser* (to be) + *De* (from).
- Practice *¿De dónde eres?* and *Soy de...* with students, focusing on their real cities/states. 

**Guided Practice: "The Human Map" (12 min)**
Teacher designates areas of the classroom as different continents. Students move to the area of a country the teacher names and shout: *¡Soy de [País]!*

**Pair Practice: The Global Interview (10 min)**
Partners practice a 6-line exchange: Greeting -> Name -> Origin -> Courtesy -> Farewell.
*Encourage students to use a "Mystery Origin" from the 21 countries.*

**Exit Ticket: Identity Check (5 min)**
Students write: 1. Their real origin (*Soy de...*) 2. One Spanish-speaking country they are curious about and why.

### 📺 Supplemental Resource Bank

> 🎬 **Watch:** Educators and students may visit the [Seño Bluemel Que Chévere YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvfq1AXJiDzXMV4VlA9ve_w?view_as=subscriber) for a video on the 21 Spanish-speaking countries. This resource helps students hear the diverse accents and regional pride mentioned in today's lesson.

### 📝 Scaffolding & Differentiation
- **Scaffolding:** Provide a list of all 21 countries with phonetic pronunciations.
- **Extension:** Students can research the "Demonym" (the word for a person from a place, e.g., *mexicano, colombiano*) for their chosen country.
- **Heritage Speakers:** Encourage students to share the specific city or "barrio" their family is from to add depth to the geography discussion.
