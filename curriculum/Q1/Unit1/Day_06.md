### 📋 Activity Procedures & Teacher Guidance (Core Delivery)

| Time | Activity Title | Procedure & Instructional Details | Teacher Tips & Guidance | Examples |
|:---:|---|---|---|---|
| **10 min** | **Activador: El Espejo de Clase** | Teacher shows photos of famous movie characters (e.g., Shrek, Mirabel). Students shout personality adjectives that fit. | Focus on "Cognates" first (*inteligente, paciente, sociable*) to build immediate confidence. | **T:** (Shows Donkey from Shrek) <br>**C:** "¡Sociable! ¡Gracioso!" |
| **12 min** | **Input: The Adjective Spectrum** | Introduce adjectives in pairs of opposites (*perezoso* vs. *trabajador*). Model using people students know (teachers, athletes). | **Grammar Alert:** Introduce adjectives that end in '-e' or '-ista' (e.g., *paciente, optimista*) which do not change for gender. | *"Yo soy inteligente. Él es perezoso. Ella es trabajadora."* |
| **15 min** | **Task: Citas Rápidas de Identidad** | Students move in a "speed dating" format. They must share two traits and find someone with at least one matching trait. | **Live-Grade:** Watch for the feminine form of *-dor* becoming *-dora*. Listen for adjective agreement for *-o/-a* words. | **A:** "Yo soy paciente. ¿Y tú?" <br>**B:** "Yo soy impaciente pero soy inteligente." |
| **8 min** | **Presentational: The Identity Shield** | Students draw a shield with 4 quadrants: 2 physical traits (Review) and 2 personality traits (New). | This reinforces the "Total Identity." Use these for a "Guess Who" game on Day 7. | **Shield:** Alto, Moreno, Simpático, Atlético. |
| **5 min** | **Reflexión: Internal vs. External** | Discussion: Why is it easier to describe someone physically than by their personality? | Connect this to "Identity." Our internal traits often define our community roles more than our height. | "Ser can describe what we look like AND who we are inside." |

### 📘 Pedagogical Blueprint: How to Implement this Lesson
> *A guide for transitioning from "Surface" to "Character" identity.*



**1. Leveraging Cognates:**
Begin with adjectives like *optimista, pesimista, inteligente, and paciente*. Because they look like English, the "Cognitive Load" is lower, allowing students to focus on the sentence structure of *Yo soy*.

**2. The *-dor* to *-dora* transition:**
This is a specific phonetic and grammatical shift. Spend 2 minutes doing a "Choral Repetition" of *Trabajador / Trabajadora*.

**3. The "Identity Shield" as Assessment:**
Look at the shields. If a student wrote "Yo soy inteligente" but "Ella es inteligente," they have correctly identified that '-e' adjectives are gender-neutral. This is a high-level "Meets" or "Exceeds" indicator.

### 🚀 Differentiation & Enrichment

* **Support (Struggling):** Provide a "Word Bank" categorized by "Like Me" and "Not Like Me."
* **Enrichment (Achieving):** Challenge students to use the word *pero* (but) to show complexity (e.g., *"Soy perezoso pero inteligente"*).
