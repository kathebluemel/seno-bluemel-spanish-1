📂 Unit 1: ¡Hola, Mundo! (Identity & Origins)
Duration: 19 Days | Level: Novice-Low

🎯 Unit Vision
This unit transitions students from zero-proficiency to basic interpersonal communication. Using a Backward Design approach, students move from simple greetings to expressing their identity and origin, culminating in a performance task where they introduce themselves in a global context.

🔑 Essential Questions
How do greetings reflect cultural values of "warmth" and "space"?

Where is Spanish spoken globally, and why does it matter?

How do I express who I am and where I am from?

📊 Unit Standards (ACTFL Lead)
