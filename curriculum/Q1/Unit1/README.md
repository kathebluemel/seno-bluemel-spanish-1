# Unit 1: Identidad y Comunidad Global
**Duration:** 3-4 Weeks | **Focus:** Establishing Identity and Classroom Community

## Unit Overview
In this foundational unit, students begin their journey by exploring the concept of identity. We move beyond simple greetings to help students define themselves within the context of their new Spanish-speaking community. By the end of this unit, students will be able to introduce themselves, share their origins, describe their physical and personality traits, and navigate the daily routine of a classroom—all while staying primarily in the target language.
