**Duration:** Days 1–20 | **Quarter:** 1 of 4 | **Level:** Novice-Low

---

## 🌟 Unit Vision
This foundational unit moves beyond rote memorization to establish a **communicative ecosystem**. Grounded in **Backward Design**, students develop the ability to navigate initial social interactions while deconstructing cultural stereotypes. The unit shifts the focus from "Spanish as a subject" to **Spanish as a global tool for connection**, representing all 21 Spanish-speaking countries and territories from Day 1.

## 🔑 Essential Questions
* **Intercultural:** How do greetings and personal space vary across the 21 Spanish-speaking countries, and what does this reveal about cultural values?
* **Linguistic:** How can I use high-frequency structures and cognates to communicate my identity without perfect grammar?
* **Global:** Why is being "bilingual" or "multilingual" an asset in the 21st-century global workforce?

## 📊 Standards Leadership (Primary Alignment)
This unit is designed to meet the rigorous frameworks of **ACTFL, NCSSFL, AATSP, and JNCL-NCLIS**:

* **Interpersonal Communication (ACTFL 1.1):** Students interact and negotiate meaning in spoken and signed conversations to share information, reactions, feelings, and opinions regarding identity.
* **Interpretive Communication (ACTFL 1.2):** Students understand, interpret, and analyze what is heard, read, or viewed on a variety of topics (Global Map, Identity Passports).
* **Presentational Communication (ACTFL 1.3):** Students present information, concepts, and ideas to inform, explain, persuade, and narrate on topics of personal identity.
* **Intercultural Competence (NCSSFL):** I can identify some typical products and practices related to greetings and social interactions to help me understand perspectives in my own and other cultures.
* **Local Alignment:** Missouri CLEs (I.1.1.A, C.1.1.A) are integrated as secondary performance indicators.
